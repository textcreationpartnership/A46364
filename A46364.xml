            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS a ſtrange Queſtion ask'd by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Who will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? a Queſtion that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates <hi>Innocence,</hi> an effectual Protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt wrong and violence: But he had been taught the Doctrine of the Croſs, he had ſeen his divine Maſter, the Arche-type of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
<pb facs="tcp:97134:3"/>Purity and Innocence, baſely betray'd by an Apoſtle of his own, contumeliouſly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Rabble he had infinitely oblig'd, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phem'd by an Impious Souldiery, ſcoff'd and laugh'd at by prophane Governors, and under a colour of Juſtice, by the curſed Arts of his malicious Enemies, formally Arraign'd, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and Executed as a Traytor to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> This was an inſtance ſo clear, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not to be convinc'd by it, that <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> inſtead of protecting men from injury, expoſe them to it: And leſt thoſe he writ to, might, (by the Queſtion he had ask'd) miſtake themſelves into a confidence, that <hi>Innocence</hi> would ſecure them from Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the inſpir'd Penman obviates the Error, by applying himſelf immediately to inſtruct them in their conduct, when oppreſt with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and Wrongs.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Golden Age</hi> is long ſince paſt, when an <hi>Univerſal Innocence</hi> ſecur'd every one from injury: The <hi>World</hi> hath ſince been in a State of War: Inoffenſiveneſs is no longer a ſufficient Guard, and by the Law of Nature the weaker yields to the more powerful. The <hi>Innocence</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> cannot ſecure him from the <hi>Violence</hi> of <hi>Wolves,</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty</hi> of <hi>Foxes;</hi> The greater Fiſh devour the leſs. The harmleſs Dove is the daily food of the Birds of Prey; and Man not content to
<pb facs="tcp:97134:3"/>have the Fiſh of the Sea, the Beaſts of the Field, and the Fowls of the Air a Sacrifice to his pleaſure, is ſo maliciouſly bent to worry his own kind, as if he thought himſelf created for the ruine of his fellow-Creatures, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of Man. Craft and Malice raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Trophies on the Ruins of <hi>Innocence,</hi> and the <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the Earth triumph in the Spoils of their Inferiors, and place their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Oppreſſion and Violence.</p>
            <p>This State of War being very uneaſy, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had recourſe to the Expedient of Laws, and Conſtitution of Governments, to retrieve in ſome meaſure, by <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the irreparable loſs of <hi>Primitive Innocence</hi> and <hi>Natural Goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thoſe ill Inclinations that made Laws neceſſary to reſtrain their Malignity from breaking into act, no ſooner found the Hand ty'd up by Laws from violent Attempts, but the Head was imploy'd to elude thoſe Laws by ſubtilty and artifice, to render that which was deſign'd the protection of the <hi>Innocent,</hi> a Snare to catch them in; to make Law an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Oppreſſion, and Juſtice it ſelf a Miniſter of injury. A State no leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to man in his civil Capacity, than that ill habit of body, that turns the moſt wholeſom food into poyſon, is dangerous to his nature, conſuming and ruining it by that very aliment
<pb facs="tcp:97134:4"/>that ſhould have repaired and preſerved it.</p>
            <p>Such is the State of that Government, where a prevalent Faction doth by colour of Law and pretence of Religion, deſtroy the Religion and Rights of their Adverſaries; who are therefore the more miſerable, becauſe they ſuffer unjuſtly under a form of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p>Such, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is the State the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in <hi>France</hi> complain of at this day: The Enemies of their Religion had vow'd it's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation: They had try'd the force of Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Cruelties and unheard of Butcheries to deſtroy the Profeſſors of it: Finding it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable by open aſſault, they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to effect by art and ſubtilty, what they had in vain attempted by force and violence, and to deſtroy by Law what they had found proof againſt Fire and Sword, Torture and Maſſacre. They procure Edicts for demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Churches, raſing their Oratories, and ſhutting up their Schools, or converting them to other uſes; the very method us'd with ſo much ſucceſs by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, for rooting out Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alarm'd at the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Enemies, arm'd with authority, and vigorouſly uſing it to their ruin, apply themſelves by Petition to their King, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb facs="tcp:97134:4"/>of their Grievances, and preſervation of the Priviledges granted them by the Edicts and Arreſts of his Illuſtrious Anceſtors: That great Prince mov'd with the juſtice of their demands, grants an Edict, That no violence be done his <hi>Proteſtant Subjects</hi> on the account of Religion. Their Enemies not diſcourag'd reſolve to purſue their point, and under ſpecious pretences of Piety, obtain au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to labour the Converſion of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> to viſit their Sick, to examine their Children, and to receive their Declaration at ſeven years old, what Religion (the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi>) they would chooſe to be inſtructed in: They improve this Authority ſo effectually and ſcandalouſly to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that laying aſide the antiquated means of inſtruction and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they took a new method for Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, making uſe only of Threats to frighten, of Promiſes to ſeduce, of Money and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to bribe, and (where theſe means failed) of force to compel Men, Women, and Children into that <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which turns all into Fiſh that come into its Net, and enſures all who go to Maſs a ſafe Arrival in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſenſible of the abuſe of the Authority of their King, contrary to his intentions, prepare a ſecond Addreſs for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
<pb facs="tcp:97134:5"/>but coming to preſent it, found all Avenues blocked up, no acceſs to his Majeſty, no redreſs in his Courts, the Miniſters of State prepoſſeſs'd to their prejudice, and themſelves look'd upon as Enemies to the State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> It was the artifice of their Enemies to repreſent them ſuch to that ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Monarch, too generous and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to perſecute good Subjects, but extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jealous of his Authority. So the <hi>Jewiſh Prieſts</hi> finding <hi>Pilate</hi> convinc'd of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Innocence,</hi> and inclin'd to acquit him, ſuggeſt, he had ſpoken againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp;c. and prevail'd with that Judge to Condemn him for Treaſon, the greateſt of Crimes, who upon a ſolemn hearing, declar'd he had found no fault in him.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Affliction to an innocent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer is aſperſion of Guilt; Tortures may crack his Sinews, mangle his Limbs, and deſtroy his Body, but falſe Aſperſions wound the Heart, diſtract the Spirits, and rend and tear the Soul in pieces. His <hi>Innocence</hi> may ſupport him againſt the pains of Racks and Gibbets, but the torture of Calumny is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is the Caſe of the <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Proteſtants:</hi> They have for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion patiently ſubmitted to the Perſecution
<pb facs="tcp:97134:5"/>of their Enemies: But they not content to have ſtrip'd them naked, forc'd them to ſeek a lively-hood in forraign Regions, and live on the Alms of people unknown, endeavour to rob them of their ſole ſupport, the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their <hi>Innocence;</hi> by perſwading the World, they are men of Rebellious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Enemies to Government, particularly Monarchy: This of all their Sufferings is the only one they are impatient of, and could not ſubmit to without a Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> The Sufferings of the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> the injuſtice of their Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ill conſequences that may attend it, and the clearing of their Loyalty, are the principal Subjects of the following Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: The three firſt particulars are peculiar to thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> The laſt ſo far concerns the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party of <hi>Europe,</hi> as the common Enemy charges them all with Principles of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: The Author, though he apply himſelf chiefly to vindicate the Reformed of <hi>France,</hi> hath not forgot to add ſomewhat in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and, by a juſt Tranſlation of the Crime, laid the Guilt of Rebellious Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at the doors of their Enemies.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:97134:6"/>
            <p>The ſight of miſery, eſpecially undeſerv'd, melts a generous ſoul into pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but of all the Sufferings our nature is ſubject to, thoſe undergone for Conſcience and Religion are the moſt glorious, and beſt deſerve Commiſeration; when out of ſence of Duty to the Soveraign of the World, for an inward and innocent ſatisfaction of mind, and hopes of pleaſure purely ſpiritual, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and fature, men ſlight all the pleaſures of ſence; and with true Magnanimity, not only contemn worldly advantages, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endure the ſmarteſt Afflictions and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Criminals have that benefit of the Laws they offend, they are allow'd to plead for themſelves: An <hi>Innocent Sufferer</hi> hath right to Compaſſion and Favour, eſpecially a Sufferer on the account of Religion, and who, on that account, hath been forc'd to ſeek in ſtrange Countries, the right deny'd him in his own. Such, <hi>My Lord,</hi> are theſe <hi>Proteſtant Exiles,</hi> who barr'd acceſs to the <hi>French</hi> King their Lord, fled for refuge to the Throne of our moſt Gracious Prince, who in Commiſeration to the diſtreſſed <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> hath made his Kingdoms a general Sanctuary, where they who could not have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, quiet, or ſecurity at home, find ſafety, protection, and favour, with the benefit of Laws, and kind influences of a Government
<pb facs="tcp:97134:6"/>infinitely more Gentle than thoſe they were born under.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> 'Tis the Glory of the Mighty to protect the <hi>Innocent:</hi> Nothing makes power look ſo venerable and divine, as imploying it aright. The higheſt pleaſure and beſt fruit of greatneſs is the conſcience to have uſed it well: That excellent Prince who eſteemed the day loſt wherein he had not obliged ſome of his Inferiors, was the Darling of Mankind: His memory is bleſt to this day, when others who mov'd in the ſame Sphear, but made ill uſe of their greatneſs, are mentioned with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Perſons of eminent dignity and power draw the eyes of inferiour mankind, as thoſe Luminous bodies that move in the upper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, which all look at, but with aſpects dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as the Apprehenſions they have of them: Thoſe they conceive of a malignant nature, they look on with horrour; but thoſe they apprehend benign and good, they behold with pleaſure and delight, with hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, with reſpect and veneration.</p>

               <hi>My Lord,</hi> Allow me the liberty to tell your Lordſhip, that among the Stars of the greater magnitude in our Horizon, the <hi>Diſtreſſed Proteſtants</hi> fix their Eyes on you, as one of no leſs Propitious than Powerful Influence: Their envious Enemies have endeavoured to blaſt their Reputation, and by Calumny and
<pb facs="tcp:97134:7"/>unjuſt aſperſions to rob them of the benefit of that juſtice they might pretend to at home, and to repreſent them unworthy any favour abroad: This oblig'd them to a Vindication of themſelves in their own Language: But that being not univerſally underſtood in this Kingdom (where they are ſo neerly concern'd to ſtand right in the opinion of the moſt loyal and beſt <hi>Reformed Church</hi> of the World) I thought it not altogether unuſeful to them, to have their Defence publiſh'd in <hi>Engliſh</hi> for general ſatisfaction: The ſame malice that aſſaulted their <hi>Innocence</hi> by unjuſt Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will be too apt to cavil at their Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cry down their defence: The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of their Cauſe, without the aſſiſtance of a powerful patronage, may be too weak to protect them. And for <hi>The laſt Efforts of Afflicted Innocence, The juſt Vindication of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Proteſtants,</hi> what Patronage more ſuitable, what Protection more agreeable than <hi>His,</hi> whoſe noble Extraction and generous Temper naturally incline to pity the miſerable, to protect the Innocent, and ſuccour the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd? Whoſe integrity and ſoundneſs in the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> have render'd him eminent for piety, vertue, and worth; and whoſe ample fortune, dignity, and honour, no leſs juſtly than ſignally diſtinguiſh him from other Men? And for that this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
<pb facs="tcp:97134:7"/>belongs peculiarly to your Lordſhip, be pleas'd to excuſe the liberty I take to beg, theſe Diſcourſes may appear in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under your Lordſhips Auſpicious Name; and that you will believe, nothing but the luſtre of your great Qualities, and the glory of your Name, appearing ſo proper to protect and grace a Tract of this nature, and the opinion of your goodneſs and condeſcenſion to vouchſafe it that honour, could have inſpir'd me with this preſumption.

            <p>I Preſume you ſenſible of your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in being born and bred a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> wherein Piety is conſiſtent with ſound reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Man may be Religious without forfeiting his Senſes or renouncing his Judgment: I doubt not but you eſteem it a Bleſſing to be ſubject to a Government the beſt conſtituted of any, and Laws ſo equally tender of the Prerogative of the Soveraign and Priviledge of the Subject, as beſt conduces to the common welfare
<pb facs="tcp:97134:8"/>of both; and you muſt be unworthy the Name I addreſs'd you by, if you do not value it as the greateſt Bleſſing on Earth, that the Church and State are under the Protection and Government of a moſt Gracious and Excellent Prince: But that which the Subject of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes prompts me particularly to mind you of, is the immediate ſource of our envy'd felicity, that our Prince is not only moſt gracious, moſt wiſe and moſt juſt, but that he is a ſincerely <hi>Proteſtant Prince.</hi> A favour of Heaven to which we princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally owe the preſervation of our Rights, ſacred and civil, the exerciſe of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and benefit of our Laws: The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who ſigh forth their juſt but fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Complaints in the following ſheets are an Evidence too clear and too ſad; That Edicts and Arreſts, Priviledges and Immunities, Liberties and Laws are too ſlight a Bulwark to ſecure Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the exerciſe of their Religion, and enjoyment of their Civil Rights under a Prince of the <hi>Romiſh Perſwaſion:</hi> Theſe Perſecuted <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the daily objects of your Charity, are the Succeſſors and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of thoſe of the laſt Age, to whoſe Loyalty and Valour <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:97134:9"/>fourth of <hi>France</hi> acknowledged himſelf much a Debtor, for the Diadem of that Kingdom, which the Monarch now Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant there wears with ſo much Glory, and the <hi>Catholick</hi> Liguers labour'd ſo vigorouſly and ſcandalouſly to rend away from the Family of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> It was in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Fidelity, and as a Princely Mark of his favour, and acceptance of the eminent ſervice they had done him; that Prince, (no leſs truly than nominally great) confirm'd to them the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, with ample Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Priviledges ratified with all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of Law requiſite in ſuch caſes: All <hi>Europe</hi> is witneſs, the preſent <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> have not degenerated from the Loyalty of their Anceſtors, but have ſerv'd their Prince with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fidelity and Zeal for the Glory of his Crown: The World admires the Royal qualities of their Monarch; his Conduct proves him a Prince every way great: He is particularly fam'd for ſtrictneſs of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and profoundneſs of Wiſdom. His <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects who are laſh'd ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely by the rod of his Authority, declare him a perſon of a generous Temper and ſweet Diſpoſition, a Man that abhors Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Violence, and is one of the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:97134:9"/>natur'd Princes under Heaven: <hi>Rome,</hi> to her ſorrow, finds him no <hi>Bigot,</hi> though a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> yet the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> are perſecuted with that rigour and extremity, they think it a happineſs to purchaſe with the loſs of all ſecular enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the freedom of their Conſcience, and by a voluntary exile to find in ſtrange Countries that Juſtice and Peace they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have in their own. Poor <hi>Hugonots!</hi> What can be a ſufficient Guarranty, for the exerciſe of your Religion, which Edicts in its favour obtain'd on weighty and juſt Conſiderations, and ratified with all the ſolemnity of Law, the loyalty of its Profeſſors, the merit of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, the innate goodneſs and wiſdom of your Soveraign cannot ſecure! If Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution be your Lot under the Reign of a Monarch ſo Generous and Sagacious, ſo free from Superſtition, and ſo full of Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Qualities as your <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>14th,</hi> ceaſe to complain of the Murders and Maſſacres under <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>9th</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d;</hi> and arm your ſelves with a Chriſtian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of greater Sufferings, and more fiery tryals of your Patience and Loyalty, when it ſhall be your misfortune to ſee the <hi>French</hi> Crown on the head of a weak, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd or Bigotted Prince: Your preſent
<pb facs="tcp:97134:10"/>King hath bravely defy'd the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts of <hi>Rome,</hi> and vigorouſly attack'd its uſurp d Supremacy, yet permits you to be rigorouſly handled; what uſage muſt you expect from a Superſtitious Soul, that will receive the Dictates of the Pope as Oracles of Heaven, and hazard Crowns to merit the title of <hi>a true Son of the Church,</hi> in executing Commands, the moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and bloudy the malice of Prieſts or intereſt of the Papacy ſhall impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? Impute it ſingly to the good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of your King, that Fires are not kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and Gibbets ſet up to deſtroy you as in former Ages; the malice of your Enemies is not abated, and your Religion, the cauſe of your Sufferings, is the ſame as then; but your King hath a Soul too noble and tender to command Innocents to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd and burnt; a Spectacle <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>9th</hi> made his Divertiſement and Pleaſure: How miſerable muſt you be under a Prince that ſhall delight in your Sufferings, and think it not juſt only, but meritorious to extirpate you, when you are thus ſharply perſecuted under ſo great a Monarch, who had the goodneſs to declare he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſacrifice his right hand for (what he calls) your Converſion? Had your ſage and wiſe Prince ſo much tenderneſs for you,
<pb facs="tcp:97134:10"/>that he would have ſacrific'd the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo many glorious Atchievements, the Darling of his noble and ambitious ſoul, for that which conceives your good, and yet is impos'd upon by the arts of your Enemies to connive at your ruine, and permit his authority to be abus'd to warrant and countenance thoſe Violences and Outrages his Soul abhors, and his eyes cannot endure a ſight of? Preſerve, as you do, your Loyalty to your Soveraign, admire his Vertues, and extol his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Triumph in the clearneſs of your Innocence, that the Enemies of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion own not any cauſe of your preſent Perſecution, but your King's Pleaſure, that there ſhall be but one Religion in his Kingdom: But lament the unhappieſt of his Education in a Religion of Principles, ſo unnatural, it would take away that variety God and Nature have unalterably eſtabliſhed, no leſs in the Opinions and Judgments, than in the Tempers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Men; ſo tyrannically, it would enſlave all Mankind to its Tenets, though never ſo abſur'd; ſo wildly ambitious, it would uſurp that Soveraignty God hath reſerved to himſelf over the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience, and force Men, contrary to both, to comply with its Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions,
<pb facs="tcp:97134:11"/>and become Traytors to God by a prophane Hypocriſie, that they may appear good Subjects to the Pope by an outward Conformity to his Impoſitions; ſo irrational, it would perſwade men to put out their eyes to be guided by it, to abjure their Senſes and renounce their Reaſon, to be governed by its Dictates: Bewail the malice and ſubtilty of your Enemies, that hath perverted your Prince, from a Father of his faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects into a Perſecutor of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> an Oppreſſor of the <hi>Reformed Church;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with a Cruelty it found not in his Nature, and ſurprized him to permit Violences and Outrages to be committed upon you, which are no leſs contrary to his judgment than they are to his goodneſs.</p>
            <p>But the Moon hath her ſpots; <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> were not free from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, and the ſagacious malice of the enemies of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> quickly finds out thoſe weakneſſes in the Souls of the beſt Princes they have acceſs to, which they impoſe upon, and manage to the prejudice of the <hi>Reformed Religion:</hi> They knew the <hi>French</hi> King of too good a nature to permit general Maſſacres, or delight in Cruelty exerciſed on his Subjects; they
<pb facs="tcp:97134:11"/>were ſenſible he is not a Bigot, to be perſwaded to yield up the Lives of his Subjects to the pleaſure of the Pope, or the intereſt of his Church; nor ſo ſilly to believe the God of the Chriſtians can be pleaſed, as ſome of the pretended Vicars of Chriſt have been, with ſlaughter of men. They obſerved ſo much Juſtice and Equity in his nature, he would be ſcandalized at a propoſal that would have engaged him, contrary to Law, and without colour of Juſtice, to violate the rights of a loyal and numerous party of his Subjects; they apprehended him too ſenſible of the intereſt of his Crown, to approve of a Conduct that would oblige him to oppreſs millions of Subjects, to whom he ought to be and had often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf a Father; and by Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>Innocents</hi> to depopulate his Kingdom, which he found too thin plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſerve his great deſigns: They conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him too jealous of his Authority, to allow any ſubject or party, how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to attempt without permiſſion from him, upon any priviledge or right of their fellow-Subjects: But they knew that <hi>Achilles</hi> impenetrable in all other parts, was vulnerable in one, that the Fort is not impregnable which has one weakneſs
<pb facs="tcp:97134:12"/>by which it may be maſtered: They were at a fault, but purſued their Game, and at laſt hit the Scent. They conſidered the <hi>French</hi> King an Ambitious Prince, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his authority, and as impatient of a Traytor as of a Superiour: They confeſs it inhumane as well as unchriſtian to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Innocents, and Maſſacre men for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in opinion, which they could no more help than thoſe of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They admit the Popes invading the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican Church,</hi> an Uſurpation not to be tolerated by ſo great a Monarch; they own it unworthy the Juſtice of ſo excellent a Prince, to violate the Priviledges granted his Subjects by his Anceſtors; they grant it to be againſt the intereſt of the State, to lay waſte his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and depopulate his Countries by forcing his Subjects into forreign parts: But they conceive it juſt to puniſh Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals; they think it both expedient and neceſſary to root out Traytors and extirpate Rebels, to deſtroy Vipers which eat out their way through the Bowels of their Mother, to exterminate thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who to ſupport a Faction and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a particular intereſt of Religion, would ruine their Countrey; and while he carries the terrour of his Arms into
<pb facs="tcp:97134:12"/>Forreign Regions, would put all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of his Kingdom into a Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and oblige him to withdraw his Forces from proſecuting his Rights, and advancing his Glory by Conqueſts abroad, to quench with the bloud of Civil War the flames that would be kindled in the heart of <hi>France:</hi> That their zeal for his Service and Glory, had diſcovered in his Kingdom a Seminary of ſuch Monſters, which muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: That they were numerous and powerful, and they durſt not attack them without particular Commiſſion and the favour of his Authority: That they were a Race of Traytors, who envyed the glorious ſucceſs of his Arms, and malign'd his Triumphs, men of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Principles, that ſucked in Treaſon with their Milk, that were Enemies to Government, eſpecially Monarchy that inſiſted on Rights, and pretended to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges independent of his pleaſure: That preſumed to think his Authority bounded by Laws, and that his Will is to be controll'd by Edicts, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Councels: That thoſe upſtart Innovators of the pretended <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> were the men they meant: That
<pb facs="tcp:97134:13"/>Seed of Hereticks, that <hi>Hydra</hi> of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, the Glory of whoſe ruine was reſerved for his Reign: That the Rights they pretend to by Law, may by Law be deſtroyed: That the illneſs of their Principles hath forfeited their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: That the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> had a Law, and by that Law the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> ought to be deſtroyed: That a Monarch without Diſpotical Authority cannot be great: That blind obedience in the Church is a preparative abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the State: That thoſe Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators allow the uſe of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, preſume to cenſure the actions of their Superiors, and diſpute the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands they ought to obey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Talibus inſidiis!</hi> By ſuch Deluſions as theſe, by ſuch artifice and cunning, was that Prince impos'd upon, to permit them to be perſecuted as diſſaffected to the State, whom he loved as his beſt Subjects: And the ſame time he oppoſes the Uſurpations of the Pope, and ſhakes off his yoke; he is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deliver up to the fury of <hi>Papiſts</hi> his <hi>Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> whoſe greateſt Crime, is their having renounced the
<pb facs="tcp:97134:13"/>pretended Supremacy of the <hi>Roman See:</hi> And to prevent the redreſs they might expect for their Grievances from the Juſtice and Clemency of their Prince, when rightly informed by their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addreſſes, their Enemies have ſo prepoſſeſſed him to their prejudice, they are barred acceſs to his Throne, denyed Juſtice in his Courts, and their Petitions of Right, rejected as Criminal, and ſtigmatized with the odious Title of inſolent Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</p>
            <p>The Defence of the <hi>French Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> againſt the Charge of Rebellious Principles and Practices, is partly the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the ſubſequent Diſcourſes: I pretend not to anticipate their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, by ſaying any thing for them, but deſire the Reader to peruſe what they ſay for themſelves; and that he will learn by their Misfortunes, to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the happineſs of being ſubject to a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince, and wiſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as far as is conſiſtent with Piety, Loyalty, and Juſtice, to render that Happineſs perpetual: Modern <hi>Rome</hi> pretends, no leſs than the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to Empire and Soveraignty: This
<pb facs="tcp:97134:14"/>pretended to Empire over the Body and Eſtate that ſets up a claim to a ſpiritual Soveraignty over Souls, to ſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of exerciſing a Temporal Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over Perſons and Poſſeſſions: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Rome,</hi> impatient of a Rival in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, hath long conſidered the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church</hi> as old <hi>Rome</hi> did <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> an Enemy without whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation it could not ſafely ſubſiſt, and hath Decreed an irreconcileable and eternal Hoſtility againſt it. And where Hoſtility is Decreed, the Maxim is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>Dolus an virtus quis in hoſte requirat?</hi> Fraud and Force are equally allowed for the Deſtruction of an Enemy: <hi>Carthage</hi> might more reaſonably have expected ſincere and perpetual Amity from <hi>Rome,</hi> than thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> may expect from the <hi>Papacy,</hi> which looks upon them not only as Enemies, but Rebels and Apoſtates, and ſolemnly devotes them to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction here, and Damnation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>If theſe Inferences ſeem ill grounded or uncharitable, and inconſiſtent with the Principles of Chriſtianity, allowed by thoſe of the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> let it
<pb facs="tcp:97134:14"/>be conſidered, whether that Religion hath not long degenerated from a Guide to eternity into a meer inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of State, and is not principally made uſe of to ſupport the Grandeur of the Papal Chair, and the Luxury of his Court: That it thinks not it ſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſupported without an Inquiſition, to root out Diſſenters under the title of Hereticks; and where the prudence of Princes hath kept out the Inquiſition, and denyed the Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> that colour of Law to exterminate their Subjects the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have been murdered by whole-ſale in general Maſſacres, ſince they could not be re-tail'd to Death by Information and Proceſs. That it makes ſubjection to the Pope neceſſary to Salvation; that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>Proteſtants, Hereticks,</hi> and reputes <hi>Hereticks, Outlaws</hi> and <hi>Enemies of Mankind,</hi> with whom no Faith is to be kept. Theſe are the genuine cauſes of the Miſeries of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> under Princes infected with the Doctrine of <hi>Rome;</hi> hence proceed thoſe Violations of Priviledges, breach of Edicts and Laws in their favour, denyal of Juſtice and ruine of their Fortunes and Lives: What Law can bind a Prince, who thinks it not only lawful but meritorious
<pb facs="tcp:97134:15"/>to break it? How hardly ſhall a Subject have that benefit of Law, which his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign holds himſelf obliged to deny him? But if Princes would conſider, that the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath Pardon in ſtore for the greateſt Crimes, but none for that of denying the <hi>Roman Supremacy,</hi> that Sin againſt the Holy <hi>See</hi> not to be forgiven: That it allows ſervice done that <hi>See,</hi> not only an Attonement to expiate the Guilt of the greateſt Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but meritorious to gain him a Crown in Heaven, who will expoſe himſelf by the blackeſt of Crimes to ſupport the Popes temporal Crown in an exigence: That the Profeſſion and Practice of the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> by <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Princes, hath not been able to ſecure their Lives from being made a Sacrifice to the Pleaſure of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the intereſt of his <hi>Church,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Aſſaſſins: Did Princes conſider this, neither thoſe who have been bred up in that perſwaſion could think themſelves ſafe in the Poſſeſſion of their Crowns, without a dependance on the Pope and a ſubmiſſion (unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Prince) to his Dictates and intereſt. Nor could any Prince bred up

                  <p>If I may be allowed to add to the Judgment you have given, I could wiſh, that Writer had in ſome particulars weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better what he ſaid, and dealt more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly.

                     <hi>for we aver, that there have not been forty of their Churches demoliſh'd within theſe ten years:</hi> If we are call'd to juſtifie this, we cannot do it: I know that in the Province of <hi>Poitou</hi> alone, near forty Churches have been demoliſh'd. And if that Paper was written by Order of the Clergy, as you conjecture, I wiſh they had taken care not to contradict themſelves: In the Aſſembly of the Clergy at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>May</hi> laſt, where the Biſhops at Court had Order to debate the affair of the <hi>Regale,</hi> and the matter in Controverſie between the King and the Pope; The Agent of the Clergy who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the Aſſembly, ſaid in his Harangue, that the King had demoliſh'd an infinite of Churches: Infinite, (according to Mr.

                  <p>You have an ill opinion of our zealous Catholicks; Methinks, the name you give them is not ſuitable to them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it hath ſomething of Contradiction in it; you call them Politick Bigots. Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſeldom joyn'd with Policy: The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians of all ages have been always oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Bigot and Devout.</p>

                  <p>Really, ſir, they may very well be call'd Bigotted Politicians, when their Devotion and Zeal for the Ruine of the poor Proteſtants is a meer piece of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; their lives and their manners prove it clearly: There are ſome among 'em, to whom we do too great an Honour, if we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97134:21"/>think they believe there is a God. I have known ſome Intendants of the Provinces, who had no Religion at <hi>Paris,</hi> but became on the ſudden in their ſeveral jurisdictions very zealous Perſecutors of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> May there not be found among thoſe of the Councel of Conſcience ſome Perſons for whoſe Piety, you Sir, would ſcarce paſs your word? I mean Biſhops that keep Concubines; Monks, that are become Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Effeminate, and theſe Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent directors of Conſcience, who approve of all Actions, ſo the Proteſtants be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, the Proteſtants; the light of whoſe Doctrine is too piercing and clear, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes too much the vileneſs of the Actions of their Perſecutors, reproaches their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and torments them in the very uſe of their pleaſures. Is true Devotion conſiſtent with maxims of Morality, ſo looſe as thoſe of our greateſt Perſecutors? But ſo runs the ſtream; thus men make their Court, 'tis the Mode, and all the World follows it.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97134:21"/>They conceive unity of Religion the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good imaginable, and that it would be the Glory of the King to procure this good to <hi>France.</hi> And this I take to be the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple they build upon, and the ground of their Actions.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hug. Law.</speaker>
                  <p>I am of Opinion, Sir, thoſe men may very well be call'd Enemies of the State, whoſe Conduct tends directly to its ruin; who inſpire into his Majeſties Subjects a mutual hatred, which obliges them to look on one another as Enemies. After that the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> of glorious Memory, had, by the Method he took to appeaſe the late Troubles, taken away the fear the Proteſtants were under, that there were deſigns not only againſt their Liberties, but their Lives, it may be affirm'd, the hearts of thoſe of either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were ſo perfectly reunited, it was impoſſible for the Enemies of the State to find a breach to enter at. But the King hath been made to tell us in one of his Arreſts, that the Kindneſs and Patience he had had for his Subjects of the pretended Reform'd Religion, had heightned the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of his Catholick Subjects againſt them. The Averſion the ſaid Catholicks have always had againſt the ſaid Religion, and thoſe who profeſs it, hath been encreas'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97134:22"/>by the publiſhing the ſaid Edicts, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Arreſts. It is really very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, the King ſhould be inform'd, that contrary to what he hath been made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Edicts of Pacification had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd a perfect peace between both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that happy union hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably alter'd, ſince the conſiderable Breaches that have been made of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts. The Roman Catholick reſumes that ſpirit of Animoſity he formerly had; he looks on the Proteſtant as a Victim ready to be ſacrific'd to his pleaſure, and juſtifies by the Conduct of his Superiors, the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he hath for his Countrymen and fellow Subjects: The Proteſtant on the other ſide looks on the Roman Catholick as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who endeavours to ruin him. He is full of diffidence, and miſtruſts every thing: He dares not ſpeak, nor open his mind free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: He is afraid of being queſtion'd for a Word: His Bowels are ſhut up againſt the poor Roman Catholick, to whom he us'd to be very open-handed: And he cannot forbear ſaying to himſelf, doth Charity oblige me to feed an Enemy to day, who, perhaps will take away my Life to morrow? The poor <hi>Hugonot</hi> in every Village looks upon his Magiſtrates and Superiors as men authoriz'd to watch all occaſions to deſtroy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97134:22"/>him. The Magiſtrates think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be harſh and ſevere to thoſe who are hated by the Court. They tell us eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, we have Order to humble and mortifie you: You may expect what you pleaſe, but expect no favour. Heretofore the ſaying was, you ſhall have Juſtice done you, but hope not for more. Alas! 'Tis long ſince we have been in a Condition to expect any favour. We ſhould now be very well ſatisfi'd, could we have Juſtice done us; for Juſtice requires men to keep their Promiſes: We ſhould eſteem our ſelves happy enough, if permitted to enjoy peaceably the Priviledges and Liberties confirm'd to us by ſo many Promiſes, Edicts and Arreſts. You cannot believe it in our Power to look upon our approaching ruin, without being troubled the ſame time to ſee others rejoyce at our fall. The injuries and reproaches the <hi>Hugonots</hi> receive from the inſulting Roman Catholicks pierce to the heart, and make deep wounds which bleed afreſh every day. In a word, that ſweetneſs of Commerce and fair Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that raign'd among the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> is broken and loſt, and inſtead of mutual Confidence, nothing appears but a general fear and univerſal miſtruſt: The Tumults in ſeveral places, the demoliſhing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97134:23"/>and burning of Churches, the Seditions rais'd againſt the Proteſtants, the injuries done their Perſons for two years paſt, are convincing Proofs of what I alledge. And matters were carryed on with ſo furious haſt, the King found himſelf oblig'd to ſtop the Torrent of theſe Violences by an Arreſt. You are not ignorant, Sir, how neceſſary it is for the peace of a State, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of a Kingdom be united among themſelves by the Bonds of Amity.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Par.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis for that very reaſon, Sir, the King would reduce all his Subjects to one Religion: By ſuffering two different par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in a State, you ſowe the Seed of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diviſions: You know the troubles the <hi>Guelfes</hi> and the <hi>Ghibellines</hi> caus'd in <hi>Italy;</hi> they that would maintain the peace of a State, muſt ſuppreſs the very Name and Memory of Factions.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hug. Law.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis not with Sects in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as with Factions in the State, the caſe is very different. Factions of State may be ſuppreſs'd by good Conduct, and deſtroy'd by time; yet a conſiderable time is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for doing it; the Example you have mention'd of the <hi>Guelſes</hi> and <hi>Gibellines</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proves it: Thoſe Factions raign'd ſeveral Ages; nor could the Name be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd but after hundreds of years, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97134:23"/>the deſolation of <hi>Italy</hi> by the fury of the Parties. But to take away the difference of Sentiments in Religion is a more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult task. Fire and Faggot, Gibbets and Axes ſignifie nothing; this appears clearly by the Hiſtory of the laſt Age. We muſt bear with a miſchief we can neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent nor remove, and nouriſh Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Parties which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, but may be preſerv'd by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the difference, and maintaining a War between them: This ſeems a Paradox, but is not ſo difficult as you may imagine. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the ſtronger Party oppreſs not the weaker, 'tis certain the weaker will have for the ſtronger a kindneſs and value for the Toleration indulg'd; And the ſtronger will permit it ſelf to be won by the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and grateful acknowledgments of the weaker: 'Tis a matter try'd and of freſh Experience. Every one knows the Union the Catholick and we <hi>Hugonots</hi> liv'd in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they inſpir'd the King with a deſign to deſtroy us.</p>

                  <speaker>Par.</speaker>
                  <p>This method of preſerving Peace is not ſo ſure as you imagine. But I could heartily wiſh a true remedy could be found for the greateſt miſchief in a State, which is, the Diſunion of its Members, and the Animoſity raigning between the Subjects of one Soveraign.</p>

                  <p>You will grant me then, Sir, that thoſe who blow up the fire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive theſe Animoſities, are great Enemies of the State. And this they are evidently guilty of, who inſpire into the King, Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Rigor and Severity againſt the Reformed. But, alas! The matter is yet more ſad; they are not ſatisfied with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to take from the King all the goodneſs and kindneſs he once had for us; but they labour all they can to root out of our hearts the Love, the Reſpect, the Veneration and the Tenderneſs we have for our King. I aver it, we love our King even to adoration; we are ſo clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of his ſublime Qualities, it adds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to our grief, to find our ſelves ſo ill thought of by a Prince, for whom we have ſo much Zeal and Admiration. Is it in the power of Man to love and to fear at once the ſame perſon? Oh! how ſhall we do it? We are told every moment the King hath a deſign to deſtroy us: He is repreſented to us with his Sword in his hand ready drawn for our ruin. 'Tis Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, 'tis Printed, that if he live ſo long, as by courſe of Nature 'tis preſum'd he may, he will ſee our Religion at an end.<note place="margin">Proceſs verbal of the Aſſembly <hi>March</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1681.</note>

                  <p>'Tis true, Sir, this is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they give of us to the King, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade us to believe to be true; for by the uſage we have at their hands, and the Speeches they give out of us, they labour to make us ſenſible, that the Grandeur of the King will be fatal to us, and that having humbled all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he will imploy his Forces for our ruin; they would perſwade us, that our preſent ſufferings are but an effect of former Threats. The King, ſay they, is become the terror of his Enemies, and the delight of his Subjects; he fears nothing. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97134:25"/>having not now any other imployment for his Power, will force you headlong into Ruine. Ah! Sir, if we were ſo unhappy (as we are repreſented) to behold with trouble the Glory of the King, it would become them to ſtudy to reclaim us by changing their Conduct. For what can give more trouble to a good Prince, than to think he hath in his Countrey a great number of his Subjects oblig'd to lament his Victories, to mourn amidſt the publick Joyes, and to look upon the Proſperity of the State as fatal and pernicious to their private Concern; being aſſur'd when the State hath not other buſineſs, it will turn its whole Force againſt them? If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one God, and one Providence, we ought to be perſwaded, that God is mov'd by the Vows and Prayers of men, and that the moſt unanimous Prayers are the moſt Efficacious. 'Tis the Intereſt of a Prince to uſe all his Subjects with equal kindneſs, that the Union of their Hearts, and Harmony of their Prayers, may bring down the Bleſſings of Heaven on the State. But there cannot be a greater Calumny and Falſhood, than to affirm we are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Proſperity of the State. Hath any one of thoſe of our Religion, who have had the Honour to ſerve the King in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97134:26"/>his Armies, been guilty of Cowardiſe or Baſeneſs whatever? Hath any of them fought with leſs Zeal, appear'd leſs Brave, or done leſs for the Victory than others in the Army? What ſigns are there we are not pleas'd with the publick Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity? What Cauſe have we given for any to think ſo? The truth is, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe us ſuch as they would have us to be, and ſuch as they who accuſe us would be, if they were in our Caſe: But God gives us the Grace to retain true <hi>French</hi> hearts, to rejoyce at the Grandeur of the King, and to leave to Providence the ſucceſs of our private Affairs.</p>

                  <p>I know it very well, without hearing more of it; I have read that Libel, and eaſily comprehend what Objections may be rais'd out of it: But, Sir, give us leave, before we enter into that great affair, to finiſh what we have begun. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy you obliged me to make, hath put me out of my way; for we began, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Enemies of the Reformed, are Enemies of the State. I have already made it appear, by ſhewing, that they diſunite the Kings Subjects, that they root out of the Kings heart, the Fatherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had for us; and endeavour to root out of ours, the Love we have for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of our Kings. This concerns the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of the State; it attacks the Principles by which it ſubſiſts: For the bond of Love between the King and his Subjects, is that which unites all the parts of this great and vaſt Body.

                  <p>I believe you Sir, We know the Goodneſs and Clemency of the King, and that he naturally hates all Violence. We ſee every day the Prudence of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. But men are led where they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had intention to go; they are mov'd by degrees to revoke all the Edicts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification. If Matters be carryed on with that Violence they have been for ſome years, and eſpecially within few months paſt, the Buſineſs will be quickly at an end, they will ſhortly perſwade the King, three fourths of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of his Kingdom are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: They will tell him, the reſidue is nothing, or not worth the thinking of; And ſo prevail with him to ſuppreſs the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts. Thus ſhall near two millions of Souls remain debarr'd the exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: 'Tis a violent State, in which Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences cannot ſtay long: The Miniſters ſhall be forbidden to Preach on pain of death:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97134:28"/>Yet they will Preach, (as before in the like caſe) in Caves, and Woods, and Cellars, and Darkneſs. And inſtead of preaching in a few places, they will preach in every place. It cannot be, but they will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, exerciſing a Religion prohibited by the State, and incur the Penalties to be inflicted by the late Edicts. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Severity of thoſe Penalties they will be Impriſon'd, Baniſh'd, Hang'd. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much it will grate the good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the King, to ſee himſelf oblig'd to permit his Subjects to be put to a thouſand Tortures, for no other reaſon but having a deſire to ſerve God. I foreſee Matters may be carryed yet farther. Among two or three hundred thouſand Perſons able to bear Arms, remaining ſtill of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis impoſſible but there is a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Fools, impatient and deſperate: In plurality of Voyces, Fools are always too hard for the Wiſe, who are often oblig'd to permit themſelves to be carryed away with the ſtream of the major Vote. Such heady and impatient People, inſtead of Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, will Mutiny, make Parties, take up Arms.

                  <p>Pardon me if I tell you, you do not apprehend me; my deſign is not to put you in fear, but move you to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I do not ſay, but the King may with all the eaſe imaginable, diſſipate the Forces of any Faction that ſhould rebel againſt him. I am fully convinc'd of it, not only by your Reaſons, but ſome ſtronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. You ſay the Reformed have neither Chiefs, nor Towns, nor Money. Have you forgot that ſaying of the Poet, <hi>Furor arma miniſtrat?</hi> Fury never wants Weapons, they who have no Towns, may take ſome. Thoſe who want Money, may Rob and Plunder. Deſpair can effect what Valour and Courage never durſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. A State that has lying cloſe in its Bowels two millions of Male-contents (though but Women and Children, and the dregs of Mankind) is in danger of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering terrible Revolutions. After the Maſſacre of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had none to head them. <hi>Dandelot</hi> was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97134:29"/>dead, the Admiral aſſaſſinated, all the Flower of their Nobility murther'd, and the Princes of the Blood Priſoners, yet they never ſpoke bigger, never inſiſted on higher Terms than then. But I expect not any benefit to the Reformed from ſuch Revolutions, becauſe God never bleſſes the deſigns of defending a Religion by Arms, of Rebelling againſt our Prince, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing War under pretences of Piety: The fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Civil War being abſolutely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Charity. Such heady and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient people by taking Arms will act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Principles of Religion, and (I aver it) particularly againſt the Principles of the Reformed: They are to expect no other ſucceſs, but to be maſſacred by the People and the Arms of their Soveraign: They would occaſion (as heretofore) mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Innocents to periſh with them. The King would certainly maſter them, but would be griev'd to ſee his Countreys drown'd with the Blood of his Subjects: What greater misfortune than this to a Prince ſo good-natur'd as ours? Beſides, a State buſied in reducing rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is in a manner abandon'd to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; who fill and tear it in pieces with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, foment Diviſions, take advantage of Diſorders, and draw Blood from all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97134:29"/>parts of it, while it ſelf opens the Veins on every ſide. Thoſe Gentlemen who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſolicit the King to Rigor againſt us, are certainly weary of the proſperity of the State; they have no mind to ſee <hi>France</hi> any longer the moſt flouriſhing Kingdom of <hi>Europe:</hi> They would bring back that Age wherein the Realm divided againſt it ſelf, call'd in the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> to enrich themſelves with the pillages of the Towns, and deſolation of the Provinces.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97134:30"/>of Chriſtianity, but privately us'd the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their Ancient Religion. Upon ſome falſe advice given <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Spain,</hi> of a great deſign the <hi>Moors</hi> had againſt the Chriſtians, they were expell'd the Countrey.

                        <p>RIght Reverend Father in God, Our Right trusty and Well-beloved Counſellor, We greet you well. Whereas We are given to underſtand, that a great number of Perſons, and whole Families of Proteſtants in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> have lately withdrawn themſelves from thence, to avoid thoſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97134:32"/>and extremities, which are brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them there for the ſake of their Religion, and have betaken themſelves into this Our Kingdom as a place of Refuge, where they may enjoy the liberty and ſecurity of their Perſons and Conſciences. And whereas moſt of them, if not all, having been forced to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon their native abodes and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in haste and confuſion, must needs be in a great meaſure deſtitute of means for their preſent ſubſiſtence and relief: We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touched with a true ſence and compaſſion of their deplorable Condition, and looking upon them not only as distreſſed Strangers, but chiefly as perſecuted Protestants, very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to extend Our Royal Favour, and Protection towards them, not doubting but all Our good and loving Subjects will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo willing and forward on their parts to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them what helps and comforts they can in this their day of Affliction. We do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in very eſpecial manner recommend their Caſe unto your pious Conſideration and Care, hereby requiring you, forthwith to give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections unto all the Clergy of our City of <hi>London,</hi> and parts adjacent, that in their ſolemn Congregations upon the next Lords day, or as ſoon as may be poſſible, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſad ſtate of theſe poor People, and by the moſt effectual Arguments of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-charity,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97134:33"/>excite their Pariſhioners to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute freely towards the ſupply of their neceſſities.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97134:33"/>Families, finding themſelves under great Preſſures and Perſecutions in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> for the ſake of their Religion, have choſen rather to leave their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Conveniences, than to hazard the Ruine of their Conſciences, and therefore great numbers of them are come, and more are endeavouring every day to come into this Kingdom for Shelter and Security. We are very deſirous that here they ſhould not only meet with all kind Reception, but alſo with that Benevolence and Charity which may in ſome reaſonable meaſure contribute towards their preſent Relief and Comfort in this their Affliction. To which end, We have ſignified Our Pleaſure to the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> requiring him to give Directions unto the Clergy of that Our City, and places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, to repreſent the ſad Condition of theſe poor People in their ſolemn Congregations, and alſo to excite their Pariſhioners to the free and chearful Relief of their diſtreſſed Brethren.

                  <p>YOU know without doubt, that the King of <hi>England</hi> proceeded further in our favour; declaring all the perſecuted Proteſtants (who ſhould come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) Denizens of his Kingdom. And that all thoſe who ſhould tranſport their effects thither in Merchandiſe, ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them Cuſtom-free; and whereas the Collection for the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants in <hi>England</hi> was at firſt made only in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Suburbs of <hi>London,</hi> the King hath commanded it ſhould be made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom. Nor is it <hi>England</hi> alone opens its arms to receive the diſtreſſed Proteſtants of <hi>France;</hi> They are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in all places of Europe: The Duke of <hi>Hanan</hi> hath offer'd to receive four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97134:34"/>Families; <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> tho very remote, declare themſelves ready to embrace the ſcatter'd Remains of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches of <hi>France.</hi> The Charity of <hi>England</hi> towards them is very edifying, yet I confeſs, I am not equally ſatisfied with all other Proteſtants who might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Refuge to their perſecuted Brethren: I have ſeen ſome of them return'd as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in deſpair from places where they had promiſed themſelves ſupport, reſolv'd to hazard all, and run again into the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they had fled from; being ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd with the cold reception and hard uſage they had found, that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hearken to the ſolicitations of the Miſſionaries.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs, the carriage of ſome ſtrangers towards our perſecuted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants appear'd to me quite contrary to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity: And if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, what will become of ſo many poor Peaſants and Tradeſmen, who groan at this day in ſearch of the means to have liberty of Conſcience? What will become of ſo many eminent Perſons, who will be oblig'd to quit their Countrey naked and deſtitute, to follow Jeſus Chriſt, and can carry nothing with them, but their Lives and their Conſciences? What can be more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97134:35"/>Lamentable, than to ſee how cold mens Charity and Zeal is? 'Tis more deplorable than the Perſecution. What is become of that ſpirit of our Anceſtors, that made them have all things common among them? That render'd every private Perſon ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the publick Calamity: In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation, if thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who were in peace and ſafety, had done nothing for thoſe who were under Perſecution, the Light of the Reformation had been long ſince put out in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hug. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>Mens Charity, I hope, will be awaken'd again to do ſomething for God and themſelves: For, in truth, the Compaſſion the Proteſtants in ſafety ſhould expreſs for their afflicted Brethren of <hi>France,</hi> is but a good Office done to themſelves. There is not a Proteſtant State Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring on <hi>France,</hi> but is under apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its Arms, and hath cauſe to fear it may one day feel the miſeries the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Kingdom groan under now: Where-ever the King carries his Arms, thoſe wicked Councellors who perſwade him to ruine our Religion, will carry their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and make uſe of the Fortune of this great Monarch to accompliſh their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97134:35"/>This may give them who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are in ſafety, cauſe enough to fear they may not always continue ſo. It would become them to merit a Compaſſion they may one day ſtand in need of, by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Compaſſion towards thoſe who are actually in miſery. But above all they ought by Works of Mercy, and the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of fervent Charity, and ſtrict Union among themſelves, to divert the Wrath of God that threatens them; and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to eſcape the greateſt of Misfortunes, the loſs of Liberty, and oppreſſion of their Conſciences. I cannot forbear adding, that the Children of this World are wiſer in their Generation, than the Children of Light, and that their Zeal not only upbraids, but may juſtly make us aſham'd of our cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: 'Tis difficult to expreſs the great pains the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> take, they ſpare no coſt to make Converts, as they call them. There are very conſiderable Funds aſſign'd for the Maintenance and Encouragement of thoſe they have perſwaded to change their Religion. The King allows out of his Revenue, vaſt ſums for gaining and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compencing theſe new Converts: We have known lewd Women converted big with Baſtard Children, who had Penſions of four or five hundred Livers allow'd them. 'Tis
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97134:36"/>a Prodigy to me, that we are not willing for the ſupport of poor diſtreſſed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, to be at that expence they of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party are at, for perverting of Souls. I wiſh, all Proteſtant States would imitate the principal Towns of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> which give Lodging in a manner <hi>gratis</hi> to all thoſe who fly thither for Refuge; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides immunity from Pariſh-Duties and Charges levyed for the uſe of the Town, and furniſh with Money and Goods thoſe that have none, till they are in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſubſiſt by themſelves, and make great Collections in their Towns for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Hug. Law.</speaker>
                  <p>Though all that could be wiſh'd, is not every where done for thoſe who leave their Countrey to ſave their Souls, yet ſufficient is done to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Kings Proteſtant Allyes and Neighbours, are much grieved at the ill uſage of their Brethren; and that diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the preſent Conduct of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in that Point, they long for an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew their Reſentment: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine upon what account our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine can be look'd upon as advantagious to the State: I will not trouble you with a repetition of the Reaſons we gave the laſt year, to convince the King of our inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97134:36"/>Fidelity, and conſequently, that he is concern'd to preſerve us no leſs than any other of his Subjects: I make no queſtion, but you have heard all our Remarks on that Subject.</p>

                  <p>Yes, Gentlemen, I have heard them, and think it needleſs to inſiſt further on that point: Time will ſhew who are in the right, you or we. Counſels are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or condemned by the Event: Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Valour is branded for Raſhneſs, and fortunate Raſhneſs commended for Valour. If the Miſchiefs you foretel happen to the State according to your Prediction, it will be judg'd you were in the right; but if a way be found by fair means, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effuſion of Blood, to bring you again into the boſom of the Church, you will be oblig'd to acknowledg our Conduct, not altogether ſo imprudent as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd; therefore without looking further into the future, I will conſider only the preſent, and muſt ſay, I do not ſee what great cauſe you have to complain. You will find it a hard task to perſwade us you are miſerably and rigorouſly dealt with, when we ſee you in full peace, enjoy every man his Eſtate, and the fruit of his Labour: I will not mince the Matter to you, by denying all we can ſhall be done for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97134:37"/>your Religion, but with excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Perſons and Eſtates which ſhall be ſpar'd: Is not this fair, and ought you not to reſt ſatisfi'd?</p>

                  <p>Ought we not to reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd, ſay you? Sure, Sir, you take us for People whoſe God is their Belly, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not a future State, but place all their happineſs in preſent enjoyments. The Principal is taken from us, our Religion and the Liberty of our Conſciences, and you would have us remain content with the reſidue. And what is that reſidue, you ſay, ſhall not be meddled with? Our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and our Perſons: Are not our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons meddled with, when they exerciſe a thouſand Cruelties, and commit infinite Outrages to make us change our Religion; when they ſtrip us of all means to live, when they reduce us to a neceſſity of ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or turning, by declaring us uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of employment, and excluding us from all Offices and Profeſſions, and from the exerciſe of all Trades we could get a lively-hood by: When Gibbets were ſet up in every corner to hang us on, and Fires kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled for burning us, we were allow'd the choice of going to Maſs or of dying. Are we not reduc'd now to the ſame choice by their taking from us all means of living?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97134:37"/>Are we not in as bad a Condition as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore? We muſt dye or change our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: 'Tis true, the death now propos'd is not hanging or burning as formerly, but I am not yet reſolv'd, whether is more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to dye in a moment on a Gibbet, or pine to death by a long train of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

You complain to this day of the Outrages committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Churches and Images in the heat of the Civil War: If our Churches were deſtroy'd by Violences as thoſe, we ſhould have the Comfort of being able to preach on the Ruins of them, and hope to ſee them rebuilt when the Kingdom ſhould be at peace. But we loſe all, not only our preſent Poſſeſſion, but all hopes for the future. We are forc'd to grieve at heart for Calamities for which there is no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97134:38"/>I ſay, to grieve at heart, for 'tis Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal for us to make the moſt innocent complaint. Periſh we muſt, and under a Formality, and appearance of juſtice: Be our Defence never ſo good, what evidence ſoever we produce in our favour, we are ſtill in the wrong, our Poſſeſſion is unjuſt, and hath no right to ground it. They are not ſatisfi'd with taking away our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but they brand us for Uſurpers: How prodigiouſly bold is the Libel in your hand, to challenge us to ſhew one Church demoliſh'd that was a Church at the time limited by the Edict, when nothing can be more notorious than that (of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of places of Religious Exerciſe lately interdicted) perhaps there are not two that can be any way ſuſpected to have been ſet apart for that uſe ſince the Edict of <hi>Nants.</hi> This is clear by the Tables of our Ancient Synods, where we find a greater Number (by half) of places for Religious Worſhip, than we have at this day. We had them at the time the Edict was made, elſe how could they appear in Acts of the Synods paſt at that time? By the Edict we are to continue in peaceable Poſſeſſion of all we then had, and what we then had, is now taken from us contrary to the expreſs terms of the Edict, and all the rights of Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97134:38"/>and Preſcription. For beſides their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts <hi>ex parte,</hi> wherein they pretend we have Liberty to make our Defence, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us unheard, they extort from his Majeſtys Declarations that ruine us, that reduce us to Extremity, and run us into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>

They ſet up the Title of them in Triumph; <hi>Arreſts paſſ'd againſt the</hi> Hugonots <hi>by the Solicitation of the Clergy of</hi> France: Our late Calamities are ſo grievous, they make us forget the former: Do but call to mind the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions publiſhed againſt us within twelve months laſt paſt, and you will ſee whether our Complaints are but figurative and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick Aggravations.</p>

                  <p>They are not quite as many as the weeks in a year, but half a dozen more ſuch would quite undo us: Have we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97134:39"/>no cauſe, think you, to complain of the Declaration that orders the Judges or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appointed for that purpoſe, to go vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit our ſick at the point of death, to know what Religion they will dye in?</p>

                  <p>The fault I find with it, is, that it opens a gap for all ſorts of Seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Violence. By the Declaration, every door muſt be open'd to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; he enters attended with a Curate, and a Miſſionary: The Arreſt excludes not the Relations of the ſick from hearing them examin'd: It neither orders them to withdraw, nor orders the Examination to be taken in their preſence. But a Law muſt always be favourably interpreted: And that the ſick may be at liberty to ſpeak their thoughts, their Friends and Relations muſt be put out of ſight: By this excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Arreſt, they get the ſick perſon into their hands, force the Husband from the bed of his Wife, and the Wife out of the Arms of her Husband, the Child from his dying Father, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his Child: Having clear'd the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97134:39"/>Room and ſecur'd themſelves from fear of a Witneſs, they promiſe, they threaten, they frighten a dying wretch and load him with injuries: they take advantage of the diſorder of his faculties occaſion'd by his ſickneſs, and the fright he is in to ſee ſo many new Faces about his Bed. A word ill plac'd, and unwary expreſſion (the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a high Feaver or Frenzy) is laid hold on, as ſufficient ground for Mr. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to cry aloud, <hi>Mr.</hi>—or <hi>Mrs.—is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dye a Catholick:</hi> Upon this, the ſick perſon is taken into their care, his Kindred and Friends remov'd from him, and he made believe, he is perfectly converted. By this Artifice he gives up his laſt breath amidſt Croſſes, and Tapers, and Images and Crucifixes, and other Utenſils of a Church, into which they ſay he is entred, though he knows nothing of it. When he is dead, they bury him with like Pomp, they take away his Children in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they ranſack his Houſe and leave his Family deſolate.</p>

                  <p>I know not whether the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt have any ſuch meaning: Perhaps his Majeſty who paſs'd it, had not: But I am ſure this was their meaning who obtain'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97134:40"/>it: It appears by their practice pretended, purſuant to it: Till our days, a mans Houſe was his Caſtle, and private habitations were inviolable Sanctuaries; Where every one (taking care, not to offend againſt Law) had free permiſſion to do what he pleas'd, at leaſt, had the Priviledge to dye undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd. But now we are not allow'd to live in quiet, or to dye ſo: Our Enemies have in this particular invented a new kind of Cruelty, unheard of even in the Ages of Perſecution and Martyrdome: If in thoſe days men were oblig'd to live in the Emperors Religion, they were permitted to dye in the Chriſtian: Can any thing be imagin'd more cruel than the uſage we find? A ſick wretch in his laſt Agonies ſtruggling with death, hath need of more ſtrength than his own to maintain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: The ſmootheſt Calm, and greateſt Tranquility of Spirit is little enough to put him in a Condition to face thoſe Terrors that uſher in the laſt moment of his Life: 'Tis ſome comfort to a man in that caſe to breathe his laſt in the Arms of his Wife, or Embraces of his Children: They cheriſh and help him, he gives them his bleſſings: Amidſt theſe mutual Offices of Charity and Tenderneſs, all their hearts melt into Tears: The one and the other deſire pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97134:40"/>and quiet to vent their grief, and give free courſe to their juſt Lamentations. A Magiſtrate enters with all the Clergy of a Pariſh at his heels: The Houſe is fill'd with noiſe and buſtle: A croud preſently gathers at the door, and with horrid noiſe and prodigious outcryes, grate the Ears of the dying Man: At this very time and in theſe Circumſtances, he who hath ſcarce ſtrength enough left to breathe out his Soul, muſt engage in a Conflict he was hardly able to maintain when in perfect health: He muſt anſwer; he muſt ſtudy and ponder what to ſay; he muſt conſider how he may eſcape the Snares laid for him in captious and ambiguous Queſtions; he muſt ſuſtain the ſhock of Threats, and encounter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and power of Authority. He muſt, for his Comfort, have the patience to hear an ignorant Curate, who to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate our Religion falſe, ſhall uſe no other Argument, but that of repeating a hundred times in a quarter of an hour with a furious tone, that if he dye in that Religion, he is damn'd as a Devil; inſtead of his dear Children and Friends, he muſt be content to ſee about him a company of men, whoſe Eyes ſparkle with rage, and whoſe Tongues (if he perſevere in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) thunder out Reproaches.</p>

                  <p>The Condition of a dying man or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily diſarms the fury of an Enemy, who having given the mortal Wound, gives the man leave to dye in peace. Are the miſeries of our Life ſo few, that we muſt be deny'd a quiet death? You have, doubtleſs, heard what happen'd in the <hi>Fauxboarg St. Marcell,</hi> ſince this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: A poor Woman being very ill, through the violence of her Diſtemper ralk'd idle: That very time the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner and Prieſts enter her Chamber, turn out her Relations and Friends who aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, make her ſay what they pleaſe, and go their ways to fetch the Conſecrated Bread and Oyl for extreme Unction. That none in their abſence might get into the Chamber, they lock the Door and take the Key with them. The Woman in the mean time coming to her ſelf, was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee a Croſs ſtanding at her Beds feet: She preſently gueſs'd what had happen'd in her Fever; ſhe riſes, and deſigning to get away, runs to the Door: finding it lock'd ſhe reſolves to go out at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, too great an adventure for one in ſo weak a Condition. Endeavouring to get down, ſhe fell from the third ſtory, and lay dead with the fall on the Pavement. A more lamentable Accident could not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97134:41"/>have happen'd, except that at <hi>Ville dieu,</hi> a Village of <hi>Poitou</hi> ſome months ſince: The Curate and Church-warden went into the Houſe of an old Man who lay ſick; they turn'd his Children out of doors, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them furiouſly, if they came near the Houſe, they ſhould hang for it: The poor Fellows frightned with Perſecutions they had already endur'd, retir'd into the Woods, and durſt not approach the Houſe: In their abſence, the Perſecutors teaz'd the old Man ſeveral days: But he had the Senſe and Courage to reſiſt their Tentations, who finding at length they could not prevail, quitted him: The poor man left thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help, was ſtarv'd to death, and was found dead, having eaten his hands.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97134:42"/>ſhe had been ſurpriz'd, and could not live in the Religion they had newly made her embrace. Having made this Declaration, ſhe was put into a Covent, where ſhe found a Well, into which ſhe threw her ſelf: Such are the natural Conſequences of the Declarations procur'd againſt us.</p>

                  <p>Can you believe, Sir, that thoſe who have ſolicited and ſurpriz'd his Majeſty to make this Declaration, have done it out of Love to our Souls, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97134:42"/>Care of our Salvation? I make no doubt, but uſe was made of that very pretence to induce the King to it, His Majeſty being uncapable of a baſe thought or mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. But I am too fully convinc'd, thoſe who firſt ſuggeſted it to the King, have very ſmall care of the Salvation of our Souls. There are many of them have no care of their own, how then ſhould they take care of other mens? Others of them have ſuch animoſity againſt us, that if they ſaw us at Hell-gate, and had it in their power to thruſt us in, they would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it: But, to ſpeak in cold blood: Let me perſwade you on this occaſion to make uſe of your uſual Sagacity: How can you imagine, thoſe who ſolicited this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, aim'd at the Salvation of mens Souls? Why ſhould they think, that a man who all his Life long hath been of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Religion, ſhould deſire at his death to turn Roman Catholick? If this man had had any ſuch thought, it ſhould have been made appear in his Life: 'Tis far better living than dying in your Religion: For that which you call Converſion, makes a man capable of Imployment and Office, it opens him the way into Dignities and great places, to Gain and great Fortune: What can be more evident, than that a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97134:43"/>to turn Catholick, would, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have intimated, not ſtay till his death, but do it in his life-time, and as early as he could? But a man in his life hath perhaps a care of his reputation, or is clogg'd with Intereſts that oblige him to diſſemble; but at his death he ſlights ſuch reſpects, he breaks all ſuch bonds, knowing that though he hath lived for others, he muſt die for himſelf. This were a good Argument in a Country where the Roman Catholick Religion is prohibited: but in <hi>France</hi> where it is predominant, where it makes uſe at this time of its advantages with a high hand, a man hath all encouragement imaginable, with all the freedom he can wiſh, and probable hopes of extraordinary recompence, to declare at any time his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to quit our Religion: Perhaps thoſe Gentlemen were of opinion that God inſpires many people at the hour of their death, who, ſhould they recover, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly follow the notions they are then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd with. True it is, Sir, you know we live in an Age of Miracles and extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations! We find them very numerous! Moſt of thoſe who perſecute us have great faith for Inſpirations! In a word, if this Declaration extended only to thoſe who in their life have made appear ſome inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97134:43"/>to alter their Religion, it might be thought the deſire of their ſalvation occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned theſe viſits: But theſe viſits are made to all, without exception to them who all their life-long have been moſt firm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd. I would gladly know what new illumination an old firm <hi>Hugonot</hi> can be ſuppos'd to have from a plain ſingle que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ask'd by a Magiſtrate in a civil and gentle manner? and if none, whether there be not ſome other deſign in the buſineſs? Is the asking of ſuch a queſtion look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a powerful inſtrument of the Holy Spirit for the converſion of an Heretick? Have we any Preſidents of Converſion by ſuch means? 'Tis clear then that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ſtrictly purſued according to the Letter, is not of any uſe to make a man change his Religion; and it is equally clear that they who ſollicited that Declaration, being men of ſenſe, did not in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by it the converſion of dying men, or the ſalvation of their Souls.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97134:44"/>Earth conſiſts in the pleaſures of Life and Liberty, to die quietly: they have already found out a thouſand ways to render our lives miſerable and unpleaſant, and invent every day new means to continue them ſo: there wanted nothing but a means to trouble us at our death, to make our yoke inſupportable: And they have hit upon't in this Declaration. Beſides, having very ſmall hopes of converting (as they call it) Fathers or Mothers, or any perſon at the age of diſcretion, they levell'd their deſign againſt Children and Infants: To compaſs this, they could not have invented a more effectual means than that they are furniſh'd with by this Declaration, whereby if they can but make believe a man died a Roman Catholick, they make themſelves Maſters of all the Children he left under age. To bring this about, it was neceſſary to open a paſſage to the Beds of the Dying: it was neceſſary to have liberty of entrance into any houſe, which could not be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authority of the Soveraign: the Kings goodneſs permitted him not to grant all they deſired (and had obtain'd by the Declaration in 1666. ſince revok'd in part, and in part mitigated by that of 1669.) which was, that the Curates ſhould have liberty to enter any houſe to perſwade the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97134:44"/>Sick to change their Religion. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted afreſh to revive this Article; but diſappointed of their ends, they reſted ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what was granted them, which was, that the Judges ſhould go into the houſes of the Sick to know what Religion they deſir'd to die in: they thought it ſufficient for their purpoſe, if they could by any means get mens doors open, after which they would take the liberty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether leave were granted them or not.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97134:47"/>deſtroying the Paternal, which is the moſt Ancient, the moſt Juſt, the moſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the ground of all other: Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, Sir, you have ſeen the Memoires and Petition we preſented to the King on this Subject: The many injuſtices of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration are ſo fully made out by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition I mention'd, I will forbear enlarging on them here: They are Injuſtices that fly in our Faces: Can we be ſilent where nature ſpeaks? Is there a greater cruelty than to rob Parents of their Children? 'Tis a mutilation that puts us to ineffable Torment: 'Tis an uſage unthought of in the Age of Torture and Maſſacre: And will you ſay ſtill, we have no cauſe to complain? we are not put to extremities? You may believe, Sir, that in taking away our Children they tear our very Bowels: And that the Puniſhments we formerly endur'd, are nothing to this: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it you will ſee ſurprizing and horrible: The tenderneſs of Mothers, the Sentiments of Religion, and the Fury of Anger, mixt together are a Compound, capable to produce terrible Effects. I fear you may ſee examples of Fury equal to thoſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Women, who finding their Children were to be forc'd from them to be baptiz'd, deſtroy'd both the Children
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97134:47"/>and themſelves to prevent it. 'Tis a new kind of Torment will diſpeople <hi>France</hi> more than all the Maſſacres of the laſt Age: For all thoſe among us who love their Religion, will certainly endeavour to ſave themſelves by retiring out of the Kingdom, though it were ſure they ſhould periſh in the Attempt: Good God! What a ſpectacle will it be to ſee the Children violently taken away from their Parents! What Cannibal heart can be hard enough to endure the ſight of Mothers bath'd in Tears, cover'd with their own Blood, ſcratching their Faces, tearing their Hair, beating their Breaſts, Sighing, and Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and making hideous outcryes after thoſe who rob them of their Children, calling them Hangmen, Robbers, Villains, and other opprobrious Names, dictated by extremity of Fury raging in the tender Soul of a Mother.</p>

                  <p>I cannot deny, but the Catholicks themſelves were ſurpriz'd at this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it hath in it ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Laws of Nature: But great deſigns, how juſt ſoever, cannot be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without uſing ſome unjuſt means: The wiſeſt Politicians are often oblig'd to do ſome ill that the may attain a greater good. The King hath a mind to have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97134:48"/>all his Subjects reunited in one Religion. The deſign is excellent, but cannot be compaſs'd without uſe of violent means.</p>

                  <p>Pray, Sir, tell me, Had not the Chriſtian Emperors a deſign to have their Subjects all of a Religion? Did not they wiſh <hi>Paganiſm</hi> deſtroy'd? This ſure was as excellent a deſign as the ruining of <hi>Calviniſm:</hi> But did they take the like Courſe to attain the deſign? Before and in the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great, the Empire had embrac'd Chriſtianity almoſt an Age. The Provinces, the Cities, the Armies, <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was full of Chriſtians: Yet the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> was almoſt all <hi>Pagan,</hi> and by the Mouth of <hi>Symmachus</hi> pleaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor, to diſſwade him from demoliſhing the Altar of Victory that ſtood at the Gate of the Senate-houſe. Yet theſe Senators were not turn'd out, nor did any loſe his Office for being a Pagan. <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> as zealous as he was for Paganiſm, received from <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the honour of the Conſulſhip, the higheſt Office of the Empire: We do not read that the Children of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> were taken from them in thoſe days, or had Liberty given them at ſeven years old to turn Chriſtians againſt the will of their Parents: The Piety of the <hi>Theodoſij</hi> and the <hi>Conſtantines</hi> never mov'd them to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97134:48"/>act in favour of the true Religion ſuch a violence againſt nature: They did not in that Age underſtand it lawful to do ill, that good might come of it: The Impiety and Fury of the Perſecutors of the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuggeſted ſuch a thought: The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors of that Apoſtate Emperor who went ſo dextrouſly about deſtroying the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, were but bunglers to our Clergymen of the <hi>Councel of Conſcience,</hi> who ſurprize in a manner ſo ruinous to us, the greateſt Prince of the World. <hi>Julian</hi> deſtroy'd the Schools of the Chriſtians, and ſhut up their Churches, but it never entred his thoughts, to take away their Children at ſeven years old to be brought up in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm:</hi> Every rational man holds it a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, that Religion is not to be impos'd by Command, but taught by perſwaſion. You have read the Book of Father <hi>Nicolai</hi> the <hi>Jacopin,</hi> intituled, <hi>De Baptiſmi antiquo uſu Diſſertatio duplex:</hi> In the ſecond Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he tells us, ſome Schoolmen hold, that <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> may be compell'd to be baptiz'd. But 'tis helliſh Divinity, a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im of Executioners and Inquiſitors: Theſe ſottiſh Divines ground their Doctrine on ſome Examples, as that of <hi>Chilperic,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to get themſelves baptiz'd, and impriſon'd one of them to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97134:49"/>compel him thereto, as <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> reports. <hi>Aimoyn</hi> writes, that <hi>Dagobert</hi> oblig'd them to it upon pain of Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Capitulars of <hi>Charlemain</hi> tell us, that Prince puniſh'd with death the <hi>Saxons</hi> who refus'd to turn Chriſtians: But Father <hi>Nicolai</hi> makes it appear,<note place="margin">Conc.

                     </note> theſe were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the Church. He quotes the Councel of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which diſapprov'd the Violence us'd by <hi>Siſebut</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in obliging them to be baptiz'd on pain of Whipping and Baniſhment. He ſhews further, that the Penalties or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd againſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> were not ſo much to force them to turn Chriſtians, as to puniſh them for Crimes otherwiſe committed: At laſt he proves, there is not in the Primitive Church any preſident for this Practiſe of compelling <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Infidels</hi> into Chriſtianity. Much leſs may you find an Example of the new kind of Cruelty exercis'd againſt us: If you meet with ſome Ordinances that command Infidels to turn Chriſtians, yet you will never find any Chriſtian Prince made a Law for taking from Jews and Infidels their Children, and hindring them to be inſtructed in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                  <p>Yet, Sir, if I miſtake not, I have read in the Memoires and Petition you mention'd, that a King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> call'd <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> order'd all Male Children of Jews under fourteen years of Age to be taken from them, and inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion.</p>

                  <p>'Tis true, but you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the Example is ſingle, that it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, being a Preſident but of the laſt Age, when the Church was very corrupt, and that it proceeds from the infernal ſource of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueſs</hi> Inquiſitions. In a word, he that reports it, though a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, had not the power to forbear ſaying it was a Jewiſh Courſe and unjuſt in the Execution, that it had not any foundation of Law or of Religion, though it ſeem'd to proceed from a good intention, and had an appearance of Piety. 'Tis <hi>Ozorius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Algarves,</hi> who wrote a great Volume in twelve Books of the Life of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Story is ſo pat, and the Reflexions of this Biſhop ſo proper for the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, I cannot forbear reading to you a Tranſlation I made yeſterday of the whole paſſage, though ſomewhat long. This Hiſtorian having repeated at large
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97134:50"/>the reaſons of thoſe who were for permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Jews to live pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably in <hi>Portugal,</hi>

                     </note> and the contrary Arguments, goes on thus. <q>
                        <hi>Emmanuel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the latter Opinion, order'd all <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> who would not embrace Chriſtianity to quit the Kingdom, and appointed a day, after which thoſe who ſhould be found within the Realm, ſhould be made Slaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The day drew near: The Jews with great diligence prepar'd for Embarquing: <hi>Emmanuel</hi> troubled to ſee ſo many thouſands perſiſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Damnation, that he might at leaſt be inſtrumental for the Salvation of their Children, bethought himſelf of a Courſe good in the Intention, but unjuſt in the Execution. He order'd all the Jews Children of fourteen years and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be taken from their Parents, and ſecur'd at a diſtance to be brought up in the Chriſtian Religion: This could not be done without terrible agitation and trouble of mens minds: 'Twas a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpectacle to ſee Children forc'd out of the Boſoms of their Mother, and wrench'd out of their Fathers Arms in which they were lock'd. The Parents were ill us'd and cudgell'd to make them
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97134:50"/>let go their hold. Every place eccho'd lamentable Cryes, the Women complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo loud, their Voices reach'd Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Many of the miſerable Fathers were ſo mov'd at the atrocity of the Action, they flung their Children into Wells. Others were ſo deſperately enrag'd, they kill'd themſelves: To add more Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this miſerable Nation, they were deny'd leave to paſs into <hi>Africk:</hi> For the King very deſirous to bring them to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, thought to induce them to it, partly by hope of Good, partly by fear of Ill: ſo that, though he ſtood engag'd by his word to permit the Jews to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque, he put them off from day to day, in hopes, time would make them change their Reſolution and Religion: This was the Reaſon, that though at firſt there were three Ports in <hi>Portugal</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to embarqueat, they were afterwards prohibited to embarque at any but <hi>Lisbon.</hi> This brought into that City an innumerable multitude of Jews: While they were ſhamm'd in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the buſineſs of Embarqueing, the day came, on which all that ſhould be found in <hi>Portugal</hi> and would not turn Chriſtians, were by the Order to remain Salves. The Ports were ſhut, ſo that a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97134:51"/>great number remain'd, who choſe rather to change their Religion (ſincerely or feignedly) than to be all their Life ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſlavery: They turn'd Chriſtians and were baptiz'd: After which they had their Liberty, and their Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd, and ſpent the reſt of their days very quietly in <hi>Portugal:</hi> This Action was not agreeable to the Maxims, either of Religion or Law. For with what juſtice will you endeavour to force mens ſpirits to receive Myſteries they ſlight, and have a perfect Averſion for? You would fetter mens underſtandings, and rob their Wills of their Liberty. 'Tis impoſſible to be done, nor does our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour approve of it. He requires a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Sacrifice, and will not accept of forc'd Service: It is not his pleaſure that Violence ſhould be done to mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, but that their Souls may be fairly inclin'd, and their Wills won to a love of his Religion: To proceed in this manner, is to encroach on the right of the holy Spirit, and attempt that by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power, which Grace alone is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to work in mens Souls, which yield at laſt to his holy Inſpirations: 'Tis only the holy Ghoſt can illuminate mens Underſtandings, and invite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

                  <p>Sir, It concerns not his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as you think. We know the Kings intentions are good, and that he ſees not the Conſequences of what they Act in his Name. But you will allow us to complain of thoſe who ſurprize his Piety, and of a Clergy who would incroach into their hands the principal management of the State: We ſee clearly their falſe Zeal will ruine us, but it will alſo reduce the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to extremitys.

He hath baniſh'd their Miniſters, demoliſh'd their Churches, and expell'd them the Kingdom. Can you chooſe but admire this excellent policy of the Jeſuits? At the very doors of the <hi>Turk</hi> they reduce Chriſtians to ſuch extremity, they have no way of ſafety, but to throw themſelves into the Arms of Infidels. And now, that the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> is at peace with <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> you will ſee how he will imploy his Forces, and what will be the Conſequence of the Counſels of the bleſſed Fathers of the Society of Jeſus: They are at this day Maſters of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> they govern all Princes, and are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in all Courts: But it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that <hi>Europe</hi> hath reaſon to look on this day, as the Eve of her Deſtruction. <hi>Germany</hi> will perhaps be a Prey to the <hi>Turk, England</hi> a Theater of Fury, and <hi>France</hi> with all the puiſſance of the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us that governs it, may fall into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I dread to imagine; for if they Arm the hand of our Soveraign againſt us, and perſwade him to ſpill the Blood of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the State muſt be weakned, by having drawn from it the moſt faithful and trueſt French Blood in its Veins.</p>

The ſuppreſſing our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Academies, convinces us effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, we have not long to continue in the Kingdom; for if the King were willing we ſhould ſtay, he would allow us our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and permit us to enjoy places ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Inſtruction.</p>

I admir'd at the confidence of theſe Penners of Arreſts in publiſhing falſities ſo groſs. I was wiſhing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97134:56"/>to ſee the Edict of Reunion of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of <hi>Sedan</hi> to the Crown: I find it repeated there five or ſix times, that the King Confirm'd to them their Academy with all Rights and Priviledges they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd under their Princes: Is not the King Maſter of it?

                  <p>I was more aſtoniſh'd at the Declaration, that gives all <hi>Hugonots</hi> who will turn Catholicks, three years reſpit for payment of their Debts: It will be eaſily granted, they have not in this been very tender of the Honour of the King, or of their Religion: Can any thing be more ſhameful, than to invite People to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion by turning Bankrupts, and ſolicit them to turn Bankrupts, by promiſing, that the Catholick Religion ſhall ſerve for a Sanctuary to protect them in their Cheats? There is not a diſhoneſt Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>France,</hi> who having three years reſpit, cannot in that time make over his Eſtate, abſcond or run away a little before the three years are expir'd, and cheat all his Creditors: This open's a gap to all thoſe frauds that deſtroy Commerce, and lay Families deſolate: Theſe are the Nets the Fiſher of the Goſpel caſts into the Sea,

Beſides the ſuppreſſion of our Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies; Beſides the Declaration that gives Children liberty at ſeven years of Age to change their Religion, we know it too well, that thoſe Bigots preſs'd for four or five more, and hop'd to obtain them before the end of the year. One to force us to kneel before the Hoſt: Another to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us uſing any Trade or Myſtery: A third to oblige us to permit our Children to be baptiz'd, and our Marriages bleſs'd by the Prieſts, under pretence of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging your Baptiſm and Marriages effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual: This is the fatal Blow, the total Revocation of the Edicts of Pacification: This Alarm was ſpread all over <hi>France.</hi> The Proteſtants thought themſelves at their laſt Prayers: Every one conſidered how to get away.

                  <p>The Declaration which gives Children liberty at ſeven years of Age to chooſe their Religion, hath made the King loſe in three months time above fifty thouſand Subjects: A Declaration that ſhall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97134:57"/>forbid us the exerciſe of Trades and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, will empty the Kingdom of near a Million, and one that ſhall impoſe on us a neceſſity to kneel before the Hoſt, will ſend all the reſt packing: And ſo the State will be ſoon rid of the <hi>Hugonots:</hi> Whether this be ſuitable to the Kings intentions, I know not, but know very well 'tis not for his intereſt: If we had not the courage vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to leave our Country, a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhall force us to kneel before the Sacrament, will make us abandon all.

                  <p>I am not exactly acquainted with the Circumſtances; the Subſtance is this. St. <hi>Hippolyte</hi> is the capital Town of <hi>Cevennes,</hi> inhabited wholly by People of our Religion: Thoſe of yours being ſo few there, that the Prieſt in his Pulpit cannot ſometimes without a ſoliciſm addreſs in the uſual Phraſe, my Brethren: The Clergy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ruine this Church of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The Prieſt took the Sacrament to be carryed to a ſick Perſon, in the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97134:57"/>that the Reformed were coming out of their Church on a day of Devotion: He ruſhes into the midſt of the Croud, lays hold on the firſt he met, and forces him to kneel; the reſt ſlip away, ſome on one ſide, ſome on the other: The Prieſt continues bawling, and requires them to kneel. He ſtays as many as he can, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their eſcape; and ſtrikes ſome with the Croſs he had in the other hand: This at laſt procur'd him ſome blows, and it was the thing he deſir'd: He informs, and (it being a buſineſs concerted) had his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ready. Upon theſe Informations, the Court orders the Church of St. <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte</hi> to be rac'd, never to be rebuilt; and to weaken the Party, baniſh'd twenty or five and twenty of the moſt conſiderable Families of the Town: That which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, is, that the Prieſts who rais'd this Sedition, is, as I am told, expell'd the Town. By this it is acknowledged, he was the firſt Author of the diſorder: Yet the Reformed are puniſh'd, as if they alone were guilty. I have not met with ſo rigorous a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſuch an Offence: When the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for adoring the Sacrament ſhall be paſt, the like will happen in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as did at St. <hi>Hippolyte.</hi> You will hear of nothing but Outrages, and Blood ſhed,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97134:58"/>and Impriſonments, and Proſcriptions and Puniſhments: A forc'd adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hath not any precedent in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. 'Twas the <hi>Pagan</hi> only would have compell'd the Chriſtian to adore what he did not believe to be God. This is to uſurp a Power over Conſcience, to require us formally to abjure our Religion, and to exerciſe the cruelleſt of Tyrannies over men. 'Tis making them Idolaters, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and Hypocritical all at a time: Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by forcing them to adore what they eſteem not to be God. Profane, in kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by way of Adoration, to that which in their hearts they deſpiſe and ſcoff at: Hypocrites, in worſhipping outwardly, what they do not inwardly: In a word, it juſtifies all the Violences of the Infidels againſt the Chriſtians. A great Miniſter ſaid not long ſince to one of our Party, who told him of this Arreſt we were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with; does it not become the Piety of the King, to cauſe all his Subjects to adore the God he adores?

                  <p>To deal freely with you, I believe you have not long to ſubſiſt; there is a ſettled deſign for extirpating your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: All the Edicts in your favour will be in a ſhort time revok'd. Some of you will leave the Kingdom, and the King will not be much concerned at it: The reſt will ſtay, and return into the Boſom of the Church in few years: You ſee what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs hath been made in <hi>Poitou</hi> in few months: Fifteen or twenty thouſand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are already converted. And when the Edicts are all revok'd, there is no doubt, but the buſineſs will be perfected with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Expedition.</p>

                  <p>Firſt then, you are to know, that the Publiſher of the Gazetts ſwells extremely the number of theſe Converts: If you account them half or two thirds of what the Gazett ſpeaks, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps account them more numerous than they are. But the falſeneſs of the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the thing I intend principally to inſiſt on: I confeſs the number of the Revolted is prodigious, and that ſo many Perſons have in ſo ſhort a time chang'd their Religion, without Inſtruction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Preaching, without Diſputes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing why is perhaps a thing not to be parallell'd in any Age. But that you may ceaſe admiring at it, I muſt acquaint you with the whole matter: Firſt you are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97134:59"/>to know, that the Province of <hi>Poitou</hi> is the heavieſt charg'd with Taxes of any in the Kingdom, and conſequently the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: Nothing can be poorer than the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants there. I need not tell you, that mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Condition abaſes the Spirits, and takes away mens Courage, it dulls their Wit, puts out the very light of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and makes men degenerate almoſt into Beaſts. For ten years laſt paſt, effectual Orders have been given, that the Peaſants living at diſtance from conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Towns, ſhould not be inſtructed; their Churches have been rac'd, and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters taken away. Ignorance joyn'd with the extreme Miſery of their Condition, and Slavery hath made them Brutiſh, and capable not only of meaneſt thoughts, but the moſt baſe Actions: The Intendant <hi>Marillac,</hi> a Perſon who had not thriven very well in the World, applyes himſelf to the Bigots, the Jeſuits and their Patriarch, Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> for repairing his broken Fortune. This man according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thoſe he had ſold himſelf to, began at firſt with the leſſer Temptations: That is, he walk'd through the Province with his Purſe in one hand, and his Sword in the other. But at laſt, the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> he had pick'd out for his aſſiſtants with ſome piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97134:60"/>Prieſts, paſs'd from Village to Village entring every Houſe, beginning with Threats, and ending with Promiſes. They told the poor Wretches, the King would have but one Religion in his Kingdom, that whoever refus'd to turn Catholick, ſhould be us'd with the utmoſt Severity and Rigor: But thoſe who would change their Religion, ſhould be well paid and live at their eaſe. Accordingly they fall a bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe raſcally Wretches; ſome valued themſelves higher than others: One among the reſt held out ſtoutly ſeveral days for ten Groats; they offer'd him a Piſtol, he ſtood out ſtifly, and would not bate them a Farthing of four Crowns: At laſt they gave him his price: This ſhameful Trade was driven in ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a manner, that theſe Convertors had provided a multitude of Printed Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, with Blanks for the Names and the Sums; which Blanks were fill'd with the Names of the new Converts and the Sums they receiv'd, in order to the giving an account to the Treaſurers of the Chamber of Accounts of the Converſion, whereof the Sieur <hi>Peliſion</hi> is Preſident: Theſe Sums amounted not to much, for ſome of the Converts had not above ſevenpence wrapt up in a piece of Paper. But for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97134:60"/>immediately after their Converſion, they were diſcharg'd of Taxes, and freed from Quartering Souldiers, and all publick Payments: On this Rock ſplit a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe Wretches, who fear'd the ſight of the Collectors of Taxes, as of ſo many Devils, and look'd upon the Priviledge of exemption from payments as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Good, and chiefeſt Felicity: You may hear the account the Gazett gives, how thoſe Converſions were made: I have in my Pocket that of the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1681. 'Tis in the Article of <hi>Poitiers:</hi> 
                     <q>The Sieur <hi>Marillac,</hi> Intendant of this Province, applying himſelf continually with a great deal of Zeal to the work of Converſion, arriv'd the <hi>28th.</hi> of the laſt month at St. <hi>Sauvan,</hi> with the Sieur <hi>Rabreüil,</hi> Vicar-General to our Biſhop. He receiv'd there advice of importance concerning thoſe of the Religion, and went away the <hi>20th.</hi> from St. <hi>Sauvan,</hi> to haſten to the place from whence he had the News: He receiv'd there the abjuration of an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible number of Perſons. Afterwards they return'd to <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and the Biſhop much affected with the fruit of this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſent Miſſionaries into thoſe parts to inſtruct the New Converts.</q>

                  <p>Perhaps, Gentlemen, you obſerve not how new this Method of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is: I aſſure my ſelf in all your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Sir, you have ſcarce met with any ſuch Convertors. Our Saviour underſtood not this way of Converſion: For had he known what belongs to it, inſtead of his twelve Apoſtles and ſeventy Diſciples, he would have ſent ſo many Intendants, ſuch as the Sieur <hi>Marillac:</hi> All the World would have been Chriſtian: To trouble our ſelves with Preaching to the Peaſants, that's filly piece of buſineſs: Shew them Money in one hand and a Cudgel in the other, you make them Saints in a quarter of an hour; and ſhall convert more in a month, than St. <hi>Paul</hi> with his Preaching ever did in twelve. Heretofore in thoſe ſimple Ages of Primitive Chriſtianity, men made it their buſineſs to inſtruct before Converſion, to make them know and believe before they made Profeſſion, and often Catechis'd them ſeveral years before they were admitted to the Myſteries of Religion: But the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettier tells us, Monſieur <hi>Marillac</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands better the Myſtery of Converſion; he knows how to convert numbers in a trice, and afterwards ſends Miſſionaries to inſtruct them.</p>

                  <p>Pray, Sir, Let us not make it a Subject of Mirth; thoſe of our Party have no cauſe to laugh at it, but to ſhed Tears, and Tears of Blood: Monſieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac</hi> hath no been always ſo careful as the Gazettier tells us. I know from good hands, thoſe wretched Converts who have been made to abjure their Religion, have not been at all inſtructed: A Gentleman of Quality, a <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> aſſur'd me the other day with an Oath, that being at the Intendants, he ſaw there about two hundred Peaſants, who were come purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to complain they knew not what Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to make, for they had been forbidden to ſay their old Prayers, and not taught any other; ſo that ſince they had been compell'd to be Catholicks, they had no Religion at all: The biſhop of <hi>Poitiers</hi> one day in good Company rally'd theſe Converſions, calling thoſe new Catholicks Monſieur <hi>Marillac</hi>'s Converts: But this is not all.</p>
                  <p>The Intendant <hi>Marillac</hi> having taſted the ſweet of theſe Converſions, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Promiſes and Threats ineffectual to bring about as many as he deſir'd, reſolv'd to make uſe of more violent Means: He and his Agents had quickly ſcumm'd off (out of our Society) thoſe baſe Souls who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97134:62"/>had no Sentiment of Religion, and were capable of ſelling their Conſciences to him that bid moſt. The number of theſe Wretches was not ſufficient to ſatisfie the eagerneſs of this Converter. He caus'd Troops to come to <hi>Poitou,</hi> and Quarter'd them upon thoſe of the Religion only, and gave them Order to commit the worſt of Outrages, till they had forc'd their Hoſts to go to Maſs. He ſends Advice to the Inhabitants of a Burrough or Village, that within ſuch a time they were to change their Religion, or to receive a Garriſon: The Soldiers he Quarter'd liv'd at diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being Maſters of every Houſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd: Maſters, Horſes and Grooms muſt all be maintain'd as they pleaſe: Beſides this, great Contributions muſt be every day paid; to one, two Crowns, to another, four, to another eight: And to prevent being charg'd any more with converting People, without having inſtructed them, a Capucin or two are plac'd in Garriſon with the Souldiers, and the Inhabitants aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd at three Crowns a day for their Maintenance: And becauſe theſe Monks by the Rules of their Order are not to fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any Money, the Souldiers receive it for them, and give them an account: Here then is a Garriſon compos'd in a very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97134:62"/>manner of Souldiers and Capucins: But theſe unuſual means are but ſuitable to that extraordinary end they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for; that the People may not any way diſpoſe of their Goods, the Intendant hath publiſh'd an Order, wherein he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them, on pain of forfeiting four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Livers, to remove any thing out of their Houſes: And that they might not by abſenting from their Houſes eſcape the Cruelties deſign'd to be exercis'd there, he hath on like Penalty forbidden them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when the Souldiers come in. You may believe, the moveables of a rich Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant cannot hold out long to bear ſuch a Charge: When the Moveables are eat up, the Souldiers proceed to Sale of the Land, under pretence, the owner hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd the Orders: Poverty is a great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and you cannot wonder many weak Souls yield to it: Yes, theſe poor Wretches would think themſelves happy, could they come off with the loſs of their Goods. All manner of Outrages are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt their Perſons. The Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men commonly enter the Burroughs with their Muſquetoons in hand crying aloud, <hi>Now for the</hi> Hugonots, <hi>now for the</hi> Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts: They have at the But of their Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetoons a little woodden Croſs, which by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97134:63"/>force or ſurprize they make the People kiſs; and having told thoſe that have kiſs'd it, that they are become Catholicks, they preſently drag them away to Church: As ſoon as they enter a Houſe, they make it ring again with execrable blaſphemies and terrible Oaths, threatning all the miſchiefs they deſign to do, if they of the Houſe go not immediately to Maſs. And they are as good as their words; for they take the Maſter of the Houſe and burn the ſoles of his feet with a gentle fire. They torture others with Vices and other Inſtruments to ſcrew in their Thumbs: They have hang'd up ſome Women at the Rafters: Some have eſcap'd death by their Neighbours coming in and cutting the Ropes. They bind Men on Benches, and drub them on the Soles of their Feet, as the <hi>Algerines</hi> do their Slaves, and the <hi>Turks</hi> their Spahies. In a Village near <hi>Niort</hi> they took three Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, bound them faſt to Benches with their Faces upwards, and pour'd in Water at their Mouths; but they had the ſtrength to reſiſt this cruel Torture: If a Husband yield to any of theſe Tentations, his Wife muſt follow him whether ſhe will or no: She is dragg'd to Church with her Hair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Ears, and ſometimes carry'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Swound: Others have been made
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97134:63"/>lay their hands on a Book without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they did, and were afterwards told they had taken an Oath on the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelifts, that they would go to Maſs: Others have been taken in Sheets, carry'd to Church, and ſprinkled with holy-water. Whereupon 'tis pretended they are become Catholicks; and if after they go to hear a Sermon of our Miniſters, they are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out courſe of Law, carryed to Priſon, and ſtarv'd there to death. The Intendant in other places hath not given himſelf this trouble. He hath thought it ſufficient to ſend for the Inhabitants of a Burrough, and tell them. <hi>Children,</hi> go into the next Room, and give your Names to my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary. The good Folks do what they are bid, give in their Names and go their ways: The Liſt is ſent to the Curate of the Pariſh, with Order to receive the Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all thoſe whoſe Names he finds there: If afterwards theſe People ſay, they made not any Promiſe, they are cruelly baſtonadoed, and frequently to death. I dare not engage further, in giving you the particulars of the Cruelties exercis'd by the Intendant and his Myrmidons, by the Souldiers and Judges of the Places, for fear, of making too long a digreſſion.</p>

                  <p>You may do very well, Sir, to particularize a little, and give us the Names of the Places and ſome of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concern'd; theſe Circumſtances would not a little confirm the truth of the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <p>If theſe Gentlemen pleaſe, I will relate part of what I know, and will be as brief as I can. In the Burrough of <hi>Aulnay</hi> in <hi>Poitou,</hi> the Intendants Deputy caus'd a Child of fourteen years to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted and impriſoned to make him change his Religion. In the ſame place <hi>Huchard,</hi> one of the Intendants Aſſiſtants, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inſtrument of his Violences, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a Serjeant and a Fryer, arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and impriſon'd a Widdow called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anne Micheau,</hi> on no other account, but to make her change her Religion, being a Woman of the Age of threeſcore and twelve. Two days after the Intendant came in Perſon, caus'd the poor Woman to be brought before him, and having ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited her very powerfully to change her Religion, he remanded her to Priſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe perſever'd, and ordered her to be put into a Dungeon, where her own Children could not ſpeak to her. He ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn'd Witneſſes to charge her with a falſe Crime, and condemn'd her upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97134:64"/>of thoſe falſe Witneſes, though neither croſs examin'd nor confronted. Ac the ſame time he caus'd a Woman big with Child to be impriſon'd, who was forc'd to change her Religion to ſave her Child, in evident danger to be loſt by her miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that inconvenient and horrible place ſhe was put in. He caus'd ſeveral others to be impriſon'd for the ſame purpoſe, that is, to make them change their Religion; ſome yielded, others held out: At a place called <hi>fontain Chavagne, Marſaut</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Election of <hi>Niort</hi> attended with two men, would have the Credit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Convertsfter the Intendants method. He went into ſeveral Houſes, particularly into <hi>Daniel Giraults;</hi> and without more ado, fell preſently upon the Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cudgelling them luſtily, led them out to Maſs, and made them lay their hands on a Book to abjure their Religion: They made their Complaint to the Duke <hi>de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euville</hi> Governor of the Province, who was ſo far from doing them Juſtice, that he gave them no Anſwer: The ſame <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaut</hi> hath frequently put his naked Sword to the Throats and Breaſts of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> to make them change their Religion: And when he met with People in the Countrey, he made them declare what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97134:65"/>they were of, and if they ſaid they were <hi>Hugonots,</hi> he caus'd them to be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten till they abjur'd their Religion. In a Borough where Horſe-men had been quarter'd and exercis'd all the Cruelties I have mention'd, one of them ſurpriz'd a Woman, and without the leaſt pity of an Infant ſucking at her Breaſt, he trod her and the Child under foot, becauſe ſhe had reſiſted three Prieſts and two Horſe-men who would have dragg'd her to Church. The Outrages committed by the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Pariſh of <hi>Echirê</hi> are incredible. A Lieutenant Reformade upon the refuſal of one <hi>Abraham Bourdet</hi> to go to Maſs, firſt broke his Cudgel in beating him, and then drew his Sword to run him through, which he had certainly done, had not fear (which gives men Wings) made the poor Men leap over a high Wall, ſo that he eſcap'd to the wonder of thoſe who ſaw him. At <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſſon</hi> in the ſame Pariſh, the Souldiers having perſecuted to extremity a poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow call'd <hi>Mary Rambault,</hi> ſhe thought to run away by night and ſave her ſelf. A Souldier runs after her, takes her, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bruis'd her grievouſly with his Cudgel, and butt-end of his Muskettoon, he took her by the Throat and would have ſtrangled her, had not another Souldier leſs
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97134:65"/>cruel than he, taken her out of his hands. Having not been able to kill her thus, he reſolved to diſcharge his Muſquettoon in her Body, but his Comrade having on the ſudden mounted the muzzle of it, he miſs'd his blow with that, he flew upon her, ſeiz'd her by the Hair, disfigur'd all her Face, and left her drown'd in her Blood and her Tears. The Cruelties exercis'd in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Vouille</hi> are not leſs: That ſame <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaut</hi> Preſident of the Election of <hi>Niort</hi> went into every Houſe with the Curate and ſome Serjeants, and made thoſe he met fall on their knees, and having laid their Hands on a Boo, they went their ways and report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Intendant, that thoſe People had promis'd on the holy Evangeliſts to turn <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and the poor Wretches were forc'd to perform what they never promis'd, or be caſt into a Dungeon. In the ſame Pariſh of <hi>Vouille,</hi> Men and Women were dragg'd above half a League to Church: 'Twas there they tortur'd two young Maids, and forc'd them to turn <hi>Catholicks.</hi> In the Pariſh of St. <hi>Christine, Huchard</hi> the Intendant of <hi>Poitou</hi>'s Executioner with the Provoſt of <hi>Niorts</hi> Lieutenant, carryed a Woman Priſoner into the Caſtle of <hi>Benet.</hi> And having put Money into her Pocket, pretended ſhe had received it for changing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97134:66"/>her Religion, though ſhe proteſted the contrary. In <hi>Littiere</hi> a Village of <hi>Poitou,</hi> the Converting Souldiers having taken a Girl of fifteen years of age, to make her change her Religion; drew their Swords upon her, put them to her Throat, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to kill her if ſhe would not go to Maſs. The Maid refuſing, the Souldiers took Fagots they found in the Court, and made a Fire to throw her in: The Father and another of his Children coming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue Fer, the Souldiers threw them all three into the Fire, where their Cloaths were burnt, and their Skins ſcorch'd in ſeveral places, and they ſcarce ſcap'd alive out of the Flame. This poor Man's Name was <hi>La Gau,</hi> and he made his Complaint to the Conſiſtory of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> where he left it under his Seal: Thus are Converſions made in the Province of <hi>Poitou.</hi> You are not to imagine I have told you the thouſandth part of what hath been done there. I have confin'd my ſelf to one inſtance of every ſort of Puniſhment and Perſecution inflicted on the miſerable People there. For in all places of the Province, they have exercised almoſt the ſame Violences; the Contagion of this cruelty hath paſs'd into <hi>Saintong,</hi> and the Countrey of <hi>Aunix,</hi> where the Sieur <hi>de Muin</hi> Intendant of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:97134:66"/>hath committed the ſame Outrages and greater, ſuitable to his harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable nature, and the mortal Enmity he hath always profeſs'd againſt the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi> So that obſerving the Connivence of the Court at all <hi>Marillac</hi> had done, he made no doubt of being countenanc'd and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd in proceedings of like nature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to out-do what had been acted in <hi>Poitou,</hi> he exercis'd Cruelties beyond Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. In the Burroughs of <hi>Mauzé, Surgeres,</hi> and all others about <hi>Rochelle,</hi> he diſpers'd all the Congregations, interdicted the Miniſters, rob'd their Houſes, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and carrying away all their Goods, Burnt, Beat, Impriſon'd or put to Flight all thoſe who would not change their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Thoſe who reſiſted theſe horrible Perſecutions wereforc'd to ſave themſelves in the Woods, and to live there on Graſs like Beaſts of the Field. The poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey People, who by reaſon of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty are deſtitute of help, were at firſt the moſt expos'd to theſe Violences. But now they ſpare not any, but without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Quality or Birth exerciſe the like Cruelty on all; I that ſpeak to you have ſeen at <hi>Paris</hi> three men (who look'd like Gentlemen, and ſaid they were of Quality) that ſwore their Perſecutors had wound
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97134:67"/>about their Necks Flax and Tow, to which they ſet fire, and let it burn till half ſtifled, half burnt they ſaid they would go to Maſs. A Lady of a conſiderable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Family had in her Houſe a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, who had chang'd his Religion and turn'd Proteſtant above four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ſince: The Intendant of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> reſolv'd to have this Man with his Wife and Children, to force them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion: He demanded him of the Lady, and ſent the Grand Provoſt to have him away: All this would not do, the Lady ſtood out ſtiffly, and ſaid, ſhe would not deliver her Domeſtick, without ſpecial Order from the King: The Intendant mad to ſee his Courſe ſtop'd by a Woman, vow'd her ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and procur'd from Court Letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Signer with ſeveral Blanks, which he intended to fill up at his pleaſure, for ſeizing the Lady and her Children, who, to eſcape his Violences, were all forc'd to run away haſtily out of the Kingdom. If the Gentry give any relief to the poor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted People of their Pariſhes, they are preſently baniſh'd their Houſes and prohibited coming near them. But that you may better comprehend how they uſe the Nobility. I muſt read you a

                        </opener>
                        <p>NEver was any thing ſo unjuſt as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution I have ſuffered from Monſieur <hi>Marillac</hi> Intendant of <hi>Poitou,</hi> and <hi>Pelerin</hi> his Deputy by his Order: <hi>Pelerin</hi> begun it the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Septemb. 1681.</hi> by quartering two Captains, ſix Lieutenants, one Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and ſixteen Horſe-men in my Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of—which was more than five parts of all the Company to be quarter'd in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Rouille,</hi> though the ſaid Territory is not a fourth part of the Pariſh. By this beginning he made appear the deſign he had to ruine me. However I forbore not the ſame day to give the Officers a Viſit, and treated at Supper and lodg'd at my Houſe two of the Commanders, who did me the honour to accept of my Invitation. On the morrow being at the Gate of my back-Court, with two of theſe Officers, and five or ſix Cavaliers, a Serjeant of <hi>Rouille</hi> ſerv'd me with an Order of Monſieur <hi>de Marillac's</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Reneatus Marillac,</hi> &amp;c. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97134:68"/>advice given us of the practiſes and ſuggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sieur's———Father and Son, We Order that Information be given by us to his Majeſties Council of the Conduct of the ſaid Sieurs———And in the mean time, we Order them to retire from the Houſe of————and not to return within two Leagues of it, until it ſhall be otherwiſe ordered by his Majeſty. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant writ my Anſwer, wherein I declar'd, that the matter of Fact charg'd in the Order was untrue: Of which Anſwer the Serjeant gave me a Copy ſign'd with his hand: The next day as I was in my Vineyard at the end of my Garden with one of theſe Captains, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerin</hi> paſs'd in the High-way cloſe by us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying a word, having with him a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter, and ſeven or eight Horſemen: He went into the Baſe Court of the Caſtle, where he found my Daughter, whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd very uncivilly, telling her, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to open the Chamhers, the Cloſets, the Grannaries, and all that was in the Houſe, otherwiſe he would break them open. My Daughter having anſwered very civilly, ſhe had not the Keys, and praying him to let her ſee his Order, he reply'd angrily, that he was the Intendants Deputy, and had his Orders in his head: You have, adds he, but five parts of the Company in your Territory, I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97134:68"/>will this day ſend the reſt hither, and reduce you to the Condition I would have you in, and carry away liy force of Arms all that is in this Castle: Then calling up thoſe that were with him, he led them to the Gate of my Out-houſe for Husbandry, and finding the Doors and Windows ſhut, he quarter'd two Horſemen there, by a Billet directed to an old Servant of mine, whom I had long kept there. Soon after he ſent thither a Quarter-maſter, and more Horſe-men with Order to ſeize all that was in the Houſe: Which Order they execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted punctually. And to vex (as much as was poſſible) a Maid of Quality and Honour, they lodg'd in my Houſe the Wenches that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd their Troop, which my Daughter was extremely concern'd at: When ſhe ſaw the Houſe was to be plunder'd, ſhe ſent on the morrow to my Nephew <hi>de la Ralliere</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat <hi>Pelerin</hi> to ceaſe this diſorder and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. The Anſwer he made to his civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, was ſaying to the Quarter-master and Horſe-men that were with him theſe very words with a furious Tone, <hi>Take that man,</hi> which they did immediately, and took away his Sword; and at the ſame time another of my Nephews, with a Gentlentan that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my Son, and another of my Children under fourteen years of Age, who were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hall, not dreaming of any ſuch
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97134:69"/>thing, were Arreſted by <hi>Pelerin's</hi> Order. True it is, theſe last were ſet at Liberty within an hour: But he ſent to the Provoſt of St. <hi>Maixaut,</hi> (who, as I learnt after, was in Ambuſh near my Houſe to take me) that he must come and carry away Monſieur <hi>de la Raillier</hi> to St. <hi>Maixaut,</hi> which he and his Archers with Muſquettoon in hand accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did, and put him in Priſon, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that no one ſhould ſpeak with him.</p>
                        <p>Monſieur <hi>de Marillac's</hi> principal deſign was to have me Arreſted, and he was vext to the heart at the diſappointment. This made him give new Orders to the Provosts of the Province, and the People he hath about him, to uſe all their endeavours to take me by any means: And thinking I would be the Sunday following at the Sermon at <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignan,</hi> to make the Affront more publick, he gave Order to a Provoſt to put himſelf in diſguiſe, and Arrest me in the Church, but I had notice of his intent, and went not to Church.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, Sir, it will be hardly believ'd, that a Perſon of my Age, and (if I may be allow'd to ſay it) of my Birth ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe or pretence expos'd to the humors of a paſſionate man, and be forc'd to ſeek Sanctuary abroad. If the Lives of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors and mine have not been ſignaliz'd
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97134:69"/>with thoſe Dignities to which Gentlemen of merit may reaſonably pretend, yet I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they have in ſeveral conſiderable imployments, ſpent their Blood in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our Lawful Soveraigns, when Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Marillac's</hi> Ancestors did all in their Power, and ſtirr'd up the People to place the Crown of our Kings on the Heads of their Subjects. I may add, that in my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I have not fail'd to do the State ſome Service, which I can prove by authentick Marks of acknowledgment receiv'd from Court, during the late Troubles: Yet under the neceſſity I find my ſelf to get out of the reach of Monſieur <hi>Marillac's</hi> Malice, who hath reſolv'd to ruine me and my Family, and declar'd as much with a great deal of Paſſion, 'tis a Comfort to me, he cannot in the leaſt reproach my Conduct. I have all my life, not only receiv'd his Majesties Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with profound ſubmiſſion, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey'd them, but have always had a great deal of reſpect for any imploy'd by him, and have conſtantly inſpir'd the like Sentiments into my Children. The only Cauſe of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Marillac's</hi> hate, and the ſole Crime he can charge me with, is my being of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion; that I and my eldest Son have complain'd at Court, of the Violences done by his Order to thoſe of the Religion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97134:70"/>and that I joyn'd with others, in ſigning the Complaints againſt <hi>Pelerin's</hi> Extortions: If the terrible Diſorders and Outrages commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Poitou,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd them to make me acquainted with their Complaints, and to ſend my Son to the Court, to apply himſelf to the King for protection; ought he for this to lay (as he hath done) a form'd deſign to ruine my Family? Or can he accuſe us of Calumny? One of the greatest Ministers his Majesty imployes, who had the goodneſs to hear us, and you, Sir, know well enough, we offer'd on forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Lives, to justifie the truth of our Charge: We deſir'd a Commiſſion of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be directed to the Biſhop of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> a Prelate of known integrity, whom, I can truly ſay, I never ſaw: Could Monſieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac</hi> have any ſuſpition of him? Monſieur <hi>Marillac,</hi> who aſſumes the Quality of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and applauds thoſe, who compare him to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> never made ſo many Converts as he: This in my Opinion, would have been a fairer way to clear his reputation, and a more legal Method to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, then affecting (as he did) to be Judge in his own Cauſe, and imploying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſts, Aſſeſſors, and others of his Train with Promiſes and Threats, Money and ill uſage, to prevail with Men to retract the Complaints
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97134:70"/>they had made of his Exorbitances, and the Outrages he had done them, and were still done by his Order in <hi>Poitou:</hi> 'Tis a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I never ſaw practis'd or approv'd in any Court of Juſtice: Much leſs will you approve his imploying (as he does) in making his Converts no other for the moſt part than Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, Men branded by Juſtice, and of a ſcandalous Life.</p>
                        <p>I am oblig'd to tell you farther, that ſince the last Orders he receiv'd, he appears with more Courage, and acts more vigorouſly than ever: He baniſhes whom he pleaſes, and ſhews thoſe who have acceſs to him Letters, he ſays, of a great Miniſter, who commands him to carry on things to what points he thinks fit, and promiſes all he does ſhall be juſtified at Court: He ſhews alſo Warrants under the Signet, which, he ſays, have been ſent him with Blanks, to put in what names he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Yet we ſcarce believe all this to be true, though we ſee ſome Gentlemen Impriſon'd, others Baniſh'd, and particularly, I am forc'd to abſent my ſelf to avoid the farther effects of his anger, having already had my Houſe plunder'd, and my Houſe of Husbandry made a place of Debauchery. And by expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an Aſſeſſor of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> this Aſſeſſor having lately obtain'd the Conduct of Troops, and march'd in the head of them, hath taken
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97134:71"/>into his Train Robbers and Out-laws, who come with Carts to take away all that the Horſe-men have not conſum'd in the Houſes they have been quarter'd in: They drive away our Beeves and all our Cattel, and ſell, for twenty times leſs than they are really worth, the Corn, the Hay, and generally, all that belongs to thoſe of the Reform'd Religion: Yet theſe poor People are forc'd to maintain the Souldiers in all their Exceſſes and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Expences, and they in recompence, without the leaſt formality of Justice poſſeſs themſelves, not only of the Goods of thoſe who are frightned away from their Houſes, but of thoſe who stay at home to maintain them; and having ſeiz'd the Goods, they ſell them publickly, and give diſcharges to the buyers.</p>
                        <p>This, Sir, is the lamentable Condition of the Province of <hi>Poitou,</hi> which all things are now in a fearful Confuſion. I am very well aſſur'd, ſuch courſes as theſe are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Majesties Intentions; and that he will not approve of them: Yet, becauſe we cannot inform his Majeſty of our Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but by your Miniſtry, I take the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to promiſe my ſelf, Sir, that you will be pleas'd to take the pains to ſpeak of them to the King, and to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and to deſire his Majesty to take my Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97134:71"/>into his ſpecial Protection, without which, it cannot be ſafe. I must alſo intreat you, Sir, to procure from his Majesty an Order, to what Judge he ſhall think fit, to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and inform of the Plunder and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries committed on my Houſe and Lands: His Majesty will not deny me the Justice of his ſpecial Protection, without which, my Family cannot longer ſubſist in this Province, after the terrible menaces of Monſieur <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac,</hi> which have already taken effect: If you will be ſo kind as to deſire it for me and my Son, we may continue with ſafety in our Houſes in the Province, and ſhall be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblig'd to you: When you undertake it, I humbly beg your pardon for the trouble I put you to, and am</p>

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  <p>But to acquaint you with ſomething yet more horrible, they begin to degrade thoſe Gentlemen that refuſe to turn <hi>Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> and ſtrip them of all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Nobility. There is in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of <hi>Niort</hi> a conſiderable Family, which came off very well in all the actions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97134:72"/>brought for twenty years paſt againſt the Nobility, to ſhew by what Right they held the Priviledges and Exemptions they pretended to: This Family having obtain'd ſeveral Arreſts in confirmation of their Nobility, and the Priviledges annex'd to it, the Informer thought fit to appeal from a Sentence of the Intendant, given in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Family. It was obſerv'd at the Council (to which the Appeal was made) that the Family was numerous, and had ſo many Branches, it fill'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. This was look'd upon as a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity, to gain at once many conſiderable Perſons to their Party. The Gentlemen were all ſolicited to turn Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and promiſes made to ſome of them of full Companies in Service, beſides Money and Favour. The eldeſt of the Family had the baſeneſs to yield, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an Arreſt in theſe Terms. <hi>Having ſeen the Evidences and Abjuration of — made before Father</hi> la Chaiſe, <hi>we confirm him in his Nobility, and diſcharge him of all Taxes: And we allow a months time to the rest of the ſame Name and Family, to make the like Abjuration. After which time they ſhall be foreclos'd, &amp;c. and made to pay the Taxes aſſes'd on them with all Charges.</hi> The proceedings of this Suit were all ſhew'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97134:72"/>me by a Gentleman of two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livers a year, who is now reduc'd to extremity, his Eſtate ſeiz'd, himſelf degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and depriv'd of the Priviledges of Nobility, becauſe he abjur'd not his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as requir'd by the Arreſt.</p>
                  <p>I will acquaint you with another very ſpecial ſort of Perſecution: The laſt year an Arreſt paſs'd, whereby the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the Catholicks to embrace the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and forbad the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to receive any Abjuration of the Catholicks, under pain of being interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Miniſtry, and having the Church demoliſh'd, wherein any Catholick ſhould have been receiv'd into the Profeſſion of the Reformed Religion. At a place in <hi>Poitou</hi> called <hi>la Mott,</hi> a Servant Maid a <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> was perſwaded by ſome Raſcals, to go with the Proteſtants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament in their Church: The Intendant upon notice, ſends for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Elders, and tells them, that though it appear'd not, that Servant Maid had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd, yet there could not be a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign ſhe had been receiv'd amongſt them, than that ſhe had receiv'd the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them. Hereupon he made a great noiſe, interdicted and expell'd the Miniſter, and threatned to have the Church
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97134:73"/>pull'd down. And if ſuch Courſes be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, what Church can be ſafe? How eaſie a matter is it for the Curates, the Monks, and the Intendants to ſend Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals to receive the Sacrament among us, without our being able to hinder them? They durſt not for ſome time commit theſe horrible Outrages in the great Towns, where the Proteſtants were numerous, for fear of provoking them to ſome deſperate Act: But now they reſolve, all places ſhall fare alike: <hi>Niort, Chatellheraut,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle</hi> have already felt the effects of their Fury. There is not any kind of Outrage, but hath been, and is done to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of thoſe Towns: They write from that Province, that there is not a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant left in <hi>Thoüars;</hi> and generally the Inhabitants of the Towns, as well as the Countrey, declare aloud, nothing but an abſolute impoſſibility of getting out, ſhall ſtay them in the Kingdom. But ſuch is their Cruelty, the Ports are guarded with all ſtrictneſs imaginable: If any one embark, and they know it, preſently they romage the Veſſel, take him and impriſon him: I have with me an Original Writing, of thoſe poor Fugitives who were lately taken and impriſon'd, which I will read to you.</p>

                        <p>YOur Subjects of the Religion, P.R. of <hi>Poitou,</hi> most humbly ſhew to your Majesty, that they are in extreme deſolation, by the unheard of Violences exercis'd againſt them for their Religion, by Order of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Marillac</hi> Intendant of the Province: They have formerly exhibited their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to your Majeſty, who was graciouſly pleaſed to declare, it was not your intention any force ſhould be us'd to deprive them of the Liberty of Conſcience granted them by your Edicts. But their Grievances and great Sufferings having ſince been infinitely augmented, they are constrain'd to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to caſt themſelves at your Majesties feet, to implore your juſtice, having begg'd leave to inform you, that they are dealt with as declar'd Enemies, that their Goods and their Houſes are pillag'd, their Perſons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted; and 'tis publiſh'd aloud, the Sieur <hi>Marillac</hi> will have it ſo, that he commands it, and that it is to oblige your Petitioners to change their Religion. Your Souldiers, Sir, whom your Laws require to obſerve the ſtrictest Diſcipline, are made choice of to execute all theſe Enormities. Inſtead of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97134:76"/>them indifferently upon all your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they are Quarter'd on thoſe only of the Religion, P. R. And when they are ſo Quarter'd, not content with ruining their Landlords by the exceſſive Charges they put tem to for maintaining them, not content with large Contributions of Money exacted from them, not content with frightning them with execrable Oaths and horrible Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when they refuſe going to Maſs, or hearing the Sermons of the <hi>Capucins</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by Order, on thoſe of the Religion, they are ſoundly Beaten, they are Bang'd and Cudgell'd: Women have been dragg'd by the Hair with Ropes about their Necks: Others have been Tortur'd: Old men of fourſcore years have been fast bound on Benches. Their Children who would have comforted them, have been abus'd before their Faces. The most moderate of theſe Souldiers hinder the Tradeſmen from working at their Trades, they rob the poor Labourers of what ſhould maintain them, and make publick Sale of their Goods, that being reduc'd to beggary, they may be ſorc'd to change their Religion: Others of them ſeeing neither Threats nor Baſtonades, nor the horror of a violent Death, preſented every hour to their Hosts by naked Swords and Piſtols, ready charg'd, laid to their Breaſts, could prevail with them
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97134:77"/>to quit their Religion, put them in Sheets, carryed them to Church, and having ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them with Holy-water, pretend they are <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> and that in caſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former Religion, they ſhall be guilty of the Crime of Relapſe, and which is yet more strange and unparallel'd in any Age, theſe poor Wretches are not allow'd the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to complain. If they apply themſelves to the Sieur <hi>Marillac,</hi> he ſtops their mouths without hearing them. They are preſently impriſon'd without Warrant fil'd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any form of Juſtice, and are kept Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners without being proceeded against. And to fruſtrate the Complaints exhibited to your Majesty, the Provoſts and Serjeants have gone from Houſe to Houſe, and forc'd the Complainants to withdraw their Complaints: If any Gentlemen take upon them to ſpeak of theſe diſorders of which they have been eye-witneſſes, they are anſwered haughtily, they are to meddle with their own Buſineſs. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they will be put into a place of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: So that this miſerable People would think themſelves utterly undone, if they were not perſwaded, that a Conduct ſo contrary to your Laws and the Rules of Chriſtianity, will not be approv'd by your Majeſty Prostrate therefore, at your Majeſties fiet, they pray with a profound reſpect, that you will look
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97134:77"/>upon them with a favourable Eye, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to their just Complaints, the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they offer at the peril of their Lives, to prove before any Judge it ſhall pleaſe your Majeſty to nominate: 'Tis from the ſole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of your Majeſty, your Petitioners can expect an end of ſo many Outrages, and an enjoyment of that Tranquility they preſume to promiſe themſelves, under the Raign of the Greatest and moſt glorious Monarch of the World.

                  <p>The Effect, Sir? 'Twas this: Order was given to the Deputies of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou,</hi> to go out of <hi>Paris</hi> in four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours, and not to return: The Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant writ from the Province, that all we informed at Court were Fables: He ſent Horſemen with Piſtol in hand, to force thoſe who had chang'd their Religion, to give it under their Hands, they had done it voluntarily and unconſtrain'd: This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Violence more cruel than the firſt ſecures him againſt all: The Court is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of theſe Subſcriptions, and call our Deputies Raſcals and falſe Informers: Not but that the Court very well underſtands how Matters are carryed: They know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that the Intendants Guards and Retinue are not Preachers able enough to Convert ſuch Multitudes by their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Miracles are ceas'd: And the King hath too clear a ſenſe, to think ſuch nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Converſions are made Naturally, and without Violence: Whence ſhould this new illumination come, I pray? Or
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97134:81"/>why ſhould it be peculiar to the Province of <hi>Poitou?</hi> Yet at Court they pretend not to believe a word we ſay, to the end they may give permiſſion to all Practices againſt us, yet be able to ſay, if any Violence be acted, 'tis without Order of the Court: Since <hi>September</hi> laſt they have labour'd more than ever, to Publiſh it is not the Kings pleaſure any Violence ſhould be us'd. His Majeſty hath had the goodneſs to ſay as much to ſeveral of his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Intendants: In the mean time, 'tis certain, that in the Provinces of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge</hi> and <hi>Poitou,</hi> the Violences and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages you have heard, are not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, but increas'd. The Sieur <hi>Maril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi> finding himſelf authoriz'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence of the Court, hath tripled his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I will tell you a very true ſtory, which will teach you what to believe of the mitigation ſo much talk'd of. Four Souldiers Quarter'd in one Houſe, having ſack'd and conſum'd all the Goods in it, and committed all Violences imaginable, to make the Maſter of the Houſe change his Religion, took his two Daughters, both grown and handſom, they lock them up with themſelves in a Rom, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten if they reſuſe to turn Catholicks, they muſt ſuffer the greateſt Extremities; and,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97134:82"/>to be as good as their words, they put them into a poſture to receive the worſt Outrage that can be done to a civil Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: To prevent which, they chang'd their Religion. I know very well, his Majeſty would be ſo far from Countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſuch an Action, that he would abhor it, if he knew it. Neither do I believe Monſieur <hi>Marillac</hi> ſo mad, as to Command ſuch Brutality. But this lets you ſee what a looſe hand is held over the Inſolence of the Souldiers; to what point they extend the Permiſſion granted them, to act what Violence they pleaſe, provided they oblige the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to change their Religion. In a word, you may judge from hence, what you are to believe of the Mitigation they tell you of: Ask me not again, Sir, as you did awhile, whence proceeds that terrible fright we are obſerv'd to be in for ſome time paſt: We ſee coming towards us that Scourge which now Afflicts <hi>Santonge</hi> and <hi>Poitou:</hi> We underſtand well enough, they will not open a Perſecution in all places at once; this would make too great a noiſe: But when they have laid theſe two Provinces deſolate, they will paſs into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: They ſcatter and lay waſt all our Congregations in one end of the Kingdom, and in the other, tell us, we ſhall be dealt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97134:82"/>with better far than we imagine, that we are to blame to take the Alarm, and ought not to think of leaving the Kingdom: That is, that we are a File of Wretched men mark'd out for death; while thoſe at the one end of the File are Hang'd or Shot to death, thoſe at the other end are ſpoken fair to, and made drink, to amuſe them, that they run not away, but may, when the reſt are diſpatch'd, be Hang'd as the others. They began with this poor Province of <hi>Poitou,</hi> becauſe it is bounded on one ſide by the Sea, and on the other ſide borders on all the Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> ſo that the wretched Inhabitants have no way to eſcape out of the Kingdom. And it is certain, thoſe who will permit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſurpriz'd, and neglect the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of getting into a place of ſafety, will one day dearly pay for their Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Security.</p>

                  <p>Your Reflections have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted me in the Courſe of my ſtory. I have many things more to acquaint you with, which will give you further Light into the Character of this Perſecutor who Ravages <hi>Poitou.</hi> He ſpreads, and cauſes it to be ſpread abroad every where with inconceivable boldneſs, that 'tis the King's intention, there ſhall be but one Religion
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97134:83"/>in his Kingdom. If any one chance to ſay any thing to the contrary, what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſoever he is of, he is puniſh'd for't. It happen'd, that three <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> ſaid, the King had not declar'd himſelf as fully in this particular, as 'twas reported he had; they were all three Impriſon'd for it. A Man of the Religion having taken an occaſion to ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly theſe Converſions made for Money, and having ſaid, the King was too wiſe to be at great expence to carry on an Action ſo baſe as that, of Bribing People out of their Religion, was Impriſon'd and Condemn'd to go bare-head and bare-foot, with a lighted Torch in his hand through the Street, follow'd by the Executioner to the Court of Juſtice, to beg Pardon for his fault: But I have one thing more to tell you, by which you may better know what a Perſon he is I am ſpeaking of: He went to Dinner at the Marqueſs of <hi>Verac</hi>'s, a Gentleman of note in the Province. While they were at Dinner, the Intendant gave Order, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the place ſhould aſſemble at the Croſs: After Dinner he took his Coach, got up on the ſtreps of the Croſs, and ſaid to the Peaſants aſſembled, <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you are to know, 'tis the King's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there ſhall be henceforth but one Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97134:83"/>in</hi> France: <hi>Turn Catholicks: Whoever does ſo, ſhall have cauſe upon all occaſions to praiſe the King's Bounty: Thoſe who refuſe ſhall experience his Severity: To prove what I ſay, ſee here, your Lord the Marqueſs of</hi> Verac <hi>come along with me to change his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> Whereupon the Marqueſs (who is a very honeſt man, and a very good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant) ſtepping up immediately to the ſame Croſs, ſaid to the Peaſants: <hi>Children, The Intendant does but jeſt with you; The King has no deſign to revoke his Edicts: And it is not true that I am come along with him, or have any deſign to change my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>

                  <p>This is ſurprizing, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of it ſelf, to make out the Character of the Man. I cannot tell, Sir, what you think of theſe Converſions of <hi>Poitou:</hi> But as for me, I confeſs, that aſſuming the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of a reaſonable Catholick, I could not forbear being of the Opinion of <hi>Ozor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Algarues. That nothing is more oppoſite to the Spirit of Chriſtianity, than a Conduct of this Nature, that expoſes ſo many Myſteries and holy things to men ſuſpected and evidently prophane.</hi> Can you chooſe but tremble, Sir, to think that at this day in <hi>Poitou,</hi> thouſands of thoſe who are forc'd to go to Maſs, and proſtrate
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97134:84"/>themſelves before that which you call <hi>Our Lord,</hi> deteſt and look upon that as an Idol which they pretend to adore: When they are ſick, they bring them the holy Oyl, and make them take the Sacrament after your manner: They obey with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the Violence us'd, but they think ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prophanely of thoſe things you eſteem ſo Holy. 'Tis, in your Opinion, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous Crime theſe Wretches commit; yet 'tis your Zealous Catholicks are the Cauſe of theſe horrible Prophanations of your Myſteries: When Violence is us'd to force men to Lock up in the bottom of their Hearts their ſentiments of Religion, it produces the effect of that Violent and inconſiderate Zeal of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who compell'd the Jews to turn Chriſtians, as I told you: The Jews profeſs'd themſelves Chriſtians, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Jews in their Hearts. Their Children inherited their Diſſimulation and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hence it is, that half thoſe <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> who, to avoid the Inquiſition, are Chriſtians in <hi>Portugal;</hi> no ſooner ſet foot in <hi>Holland,</hi> but they are Jews: Thoſe <hi>Hugonots</hi> who have been forc'd to turn <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> will inſpire into their Children their Religion, and the diſquiet of their Spirit: Theſe Sentiments will be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97134:84"/>tranſmitted from Generation to Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a Seed of Rebellion, that will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways incline this People to ſhake off the Yoke impos'd on their Conſcience, as Soon as they have opportunity. So that by the Courſe now taken, inſtead of gaining Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to God, you raiſe Enemies to the State. And I had reaſon to ſay, that by the Method now us'd for Converſion, you will make you a Church of Rogues and Villains, of Atheiſtical and Prophane Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, deſtitute both of Religion and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Converſion at this day is a Cloak to cover Debauches, and the moſt abominable Enormities: Let the moſt infamous of men profeſs himſelf a Catholick, he is preſently become a right honeſt man: That Church which claims the title of Holy as proper to it ſelf, opens her Gates to Bankrupts and Cheats, and exhorts men to become Bankrupts by turning <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> which is a ſure Means of Pardon and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion for all Sins, and in a word, a Salve for all Sores, a Remedy for all Evils.</p>

                  <p>Give me leave to tell you a little ſtory, not impertinent to the Purpoſe which I had the other day from an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer: You know, 'tis now every ones buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make Converts: 'Tis the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gentlemen and Officers of War,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97134:85"/>as well as of the <hi>Bigots:</hi> A Souldier of the Garriſon of <hi>Friburg,</hi> having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a conſiderable Robbery, was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd for it. He had wit enough to know, it would go very hard with him, unleſs he could find Favour. The firſt Queſtion ask'd him in Priſon, was, what Religion he was of; to which he anſwered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Heſitation, he was a <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> Preſently flock'd about him all the Devotes of the Town, and, in the Head of them, Madam <hi>de Chamilly</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Wife. Never Martyr made a more reſolute Defence than this Souldier, who was look'd upon as a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> would ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Burn than turn. Monſieur <hi>de Chamilly</hi> the Governor of the place, came in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Priſon, ſpoke home to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and made him underſtand, it would go very ill with him, if he did not turn <hi>Catholick:</hi> The Souldier was not a whit mov'd at all this: But at length he began to relent and yield to the gentle inſtances of the Lady Governeſs. Yet not without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a formal Treaty, for fear of a ſurprize, and being hang'd when conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In ſhort, they gave him all the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he deſir'd for his Life, and they kept their words. When the Souldier was got clearly off, his Comrades made it appear
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97134:85"/>he had never been a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> but to the day of his impriſonment had always been a <hi>Roman-Catholick:</hi> Madam <hi>de Chamilly</hi> was ſo vex'd when ſhe knew it, ſhe would have had the Souldier try'd again for his Crime: But the buſineſs was over, he had obtain'd his Pardon, and the Matter was paſt bringing about.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97134:87"/>ſo unfortunate to render themſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thoſe Conceſſions: For if I were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to call to mind, and relate here what paſs'd in the Raign of</hi> Lewis <hi>the</hi> 13th <hi>of triumphant Memory, they would find it very difficult to perſwade the World of the truth of what they ſay: We may ſee by the Edicts publiſhed on that occaſion, to what point the diſobedience of thoſe Gentlemen had reduc'd that great Prince:</hi> You may read what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and ſee the terms the Edict of <hi>Niort</hi> of <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1621. is penn'd in, where the King complains of Exorbitances com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by thoſe of your Religion, of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Aſſemblies, of Rebellions, of taking up Arms, of Orders ſent into the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ſeize his Majeſties Revenue and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, of Commiſſions given for making great Guns, and for raiſing of Souldiers: You will meet with the ſieges of <hi>Montauban, Rochell, Montpellier</hi> and <hi>Privas,</hi> and many actions of Rebellion committed by you in the late times, when you would not obey the King's Orders, whereby your Churches were to be demoliſh'd, and you were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to preach in certain places: But hear what he ſays after: <hi>To which they add,</hi> as if they were the moſt miſerable People of the World, that without looking back into times long ſince paſt, their preſent
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97134:88"/>Condition is very different from that they were in ſome years ago: We know very well theſe Gentlemen ſigh for thoſe times, they call, longſince paſt, in which they were ſo formidable: 'Tis true, we are not now in the times of their Enterprizes of <hi>Ambois</hi> and <hi>Meaux,</hi> and thoſe other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of theirs, when they call'd in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Rheiters</hi> to their aſſiſtance to Sack all our Provinces, to Rob and pull down our Churches, to ſurprize the Towns of greateſt importance, to give Battel within view of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in ſight of their King.<note place="margin">The Battel of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> in <hi>1567.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, Before you anſwer this Anonymus Author, I think you may do well to ſpeak a little to what I read to day in a Book of Dr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> intituled, <hi>The Overthrow of the Morals of Jeſus Christ by the</hi> Calviniſts: I ſee it on the Table there, and will, if you pleaſe, read you the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. <hi>The firſt Chriſtians had no other Arms but their Faith and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Book 1 Ch. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Nothing could ever move them to uſe force for ruining Idolatry. But as for them, as ſoon as they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Condition to reſiſt the Powers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by God, they fill'd</hi> Europe <hi>with bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Wars, they chang'd the Governments of States, broke down the Images, polluted the Altars, burnt the Churches, and prophan'd the moſt holy things.</hi> You know this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath gain'd himſelf a great Reputation among his Party: And what he ſays is of more weight, than what is ſaid by an Author without Merit and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Name.</p>

                  <p>The Charge is the ſame, though the Accuſers are different. By anſwering either, we anſwer both. Save that Dr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> aims farther than the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus Church-man, and lays his Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion general, againſt all the Reformed of <hi>Europe,</hi> as if they had kindled a War and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97134:89"/>alter'd the Government, where-ever the Reformation was introduc'd: The genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Charge deſerves a particular Conſideration, and if theſe Gentlemen pleaſe, I will let them ſee how unjuſt it is.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Par.</speaker>
                  <p>We ſhall gladly give you the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 'Tis a thing we had to ſay to you, in Juſtification of the Conduct of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters againſt you, and of the deſign the King hath to deſtroy you. And I explain it thus: You are naturally inclin'd to a Republican Government, you hate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and your Sect hath not made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Spirit of Rebellion that animates it in <hi>France</hi> alone, but in the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in all places where it is eſtabliſh'd, you have ſhaken off the Yoke of your Lawful Princes, and ſetled your Religion by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Arms againſt your Soveraigns.</p>

                  <p>If a Gentleman ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted as you, can charge us ſo unjuſtly, what Equity can we expect from thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary underſtandings which are guided wholly by prejudice? To hear you ſpeak, one would think we had in every place ſet up the Standard of Rebellion: And that like Mahomet we had eſtabliſh'd our Sect by force of Arms. The ground of all this is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97134:89"/>no other, but that in the time of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> withdrew themſelves from under the Dominion of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany</hi> had ſome engagements with <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> To let you ſee the injuſtice of this Complaint, I muſt intreat you to take a ſhort view of the States, where our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is eſtabliſh'd; and you will ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath entred every where by Arms and Rebellion. As to <hi>England,</hi> all the World knows, the Reformation was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd there by Authority of the Soveraign, not by popular Sedition: <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> ſhook off the Yoke of the Pope, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchis'd his Kingdom from the Tyranny of the Court of <hi>Rome. Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> his Son and Succeſſor finiſhed what he began. <hi>Mary</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd all her Father and Brother had done, and brought the Kingdom again under the Dominion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Siſter overthrew all <hi>Mary</hi> had done, reſtabliſh'd the Reformation of the Proteſtants in all her Dominions, and ſtrengthned it by a Raign of above forty years. <hi>Swede</hi> was reform'd under the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Gustavus Erikson,</hi> whom your moſt Catholick Writers cannot reproach with any thing, but his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97134:90"/>the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. He was deſcended of the Ancient <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings, and Grandchild to <hi>Charles Chanut</hi> King of <hi>Swede.</hi> He was choſen King of <hi>Swede,</hi> by all the States of that Kingdom with univerſal joy, and great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, as having merited that Honour by the great Service he had done his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in delivering it from the tyranny of the <hi>Danes:</hi> This then was no uſurper, but a Lawful King: A Prince of ſo much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wiſdom as <hi>Swede</hi> ever had. He Raign'd happily thirty ſeven years, and in acknowledgment of his Merit, the <hi>Swedes</hi> made their Crown hereditary in favour of his Children, which had before been Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. This Prince reform'd Religion in his Countries without Violence, without Threats, but by fair and gentle Means, without a Sword drawn, or drop of Blood ſhed: <hi>Denmark</hi> receiv'd the Reformation the ſame time under <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> his Son without Violence, and only by the Authority of theſe two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The laſt <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was <hi>Christiern</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> whom <hi>F. Maimburg,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> deſcribes as a Monſter. He aſſur'd himſelf the Conqueſt of <hi>Swede</hi> by the moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and barbarous Action Hiſtory ever
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97134:90"/>mention'd. That is, by <hi>Maſſacring</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and all the flower of the Nobility of the Kingdom at a Feaſt he invited them to: This Tyrant was driven out of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> by his Subjects there, who call'd in <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> and plac'd him on the Throne. This <hi>Frederick</hi> was a Prince as eminent for wiſdom, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for goodneſs, as <hi>Chriſtern</hi> the laſt who made profeſſion there of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion, was infamous for his Wickedneſs, Treachery and Cruelty. For proof of this truth, I rely not on a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lyable to ſuſpition, but on Father <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> in his firſt Book of the Hiſtory of <hi>Lutheraniſm:</hi> I have already made out a conſiderable number of the Reformed Countries, where it appears the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not introduc'd by revolt of the Subject, but eſtabliſh'd by Authority of the Soveraign. The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> were a free State before the Reformation, and therefore at liberty to make choice of their Religion, and may be added to the number of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries reform'd without Rebellion.</p>

                  <p>Let me adviſe you, Sir, to ſtop there: For if you ſtep but a little further, you will come to <hi>Geneva,</hi> your Metropolis and your <hi>Rome:</hi> And I believe, you will find it a hard task, to juſtifie their manner
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97134:91"/>of changing the Ancient Religion there: They expell'd their Biſhop, depriv'd the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> of the ancient Rights they had in the City, erected themſelves into a ſoveraign Republick againſt all ſorts of Right, Humane and Divine.</p>

                  <p>I think, Gentlemen, you have no cauſe to ſuſpect the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneva,</hi> lately publiſhed by Monſieur <hi>Spon:</hi> He affects a ſincerity not very pleaſing to the Proteſtants: They of <hi>Geneva</hi> have judg'd it ſo little favourable to them, they have prohibited the ſale of the Book in their City. And it has pleas'd the Enemies of the Proteſtants ſo well, they have given it high Elogies and magnificent Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: However I will rely on what that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays. If you read that Hiſtory, Sir, you will find the Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> was not in any Age Soveraign of the City; true it is, he had ſome rights over the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties of it, as ſome Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> (particularly thoſe who are Dukes, Earls, and Peers of the Kingdom) have over their Sees and Epiſcopal Cities, as the Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> had there, as the Elector and Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> hath over that City: But theſe are not rights of Soveraignty: The Biſhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> never was a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince, but the Syndic and Councel
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97134:91"/>of the City have always been Soveraign Magiſtrates in Civil Affairs: The Hiſtorian tells you further; the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any lawful right over the City of <hi>Geneva:</hi> They have had Judges who were called <hi>Vidons;</hi> but the Judges had juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over no other but <hi>Savoyards,</hi> ſettled in the Territory of <hi>Geneva:</hi> And 'twas by meer ſufferance of the <hi>Genevois,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> had a right of Jurisdiction over the <hi>Savoyards</hi> in their City. 'Tis confeſs'd, the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> have ſometimes kept their Court in <hi>Geneva,</hi> but without any Authority, other than the permiſſion of the <hi>Syndics</hi> and Councel of the City. This Author informs you alſo, that the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> reſolv'd at any rate to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Geneva,</hi> got a Creature of theirs, <hi>Peter de la Baum</hi> to be made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. This man, being a Traytor to the City, he ought to have protected, did all in his Power to bring it under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the <hi>Savoyards:</hi> Thoſe who moſt vigorouſly oppos'd this Enterprize, and oblig'd him firſt to retire, were very Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Roman-Catholicks.</hi> They put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the protection of the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> which had been, and was then of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> perſwaſion. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reformed was preach'd in the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97134:92"/>City, many were converted, the Biſhop return'd to oppoſe them. He had a great Conteſt with the Senate about ſome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, he pretended, belong'd to him, in prejudice of the Councel of the City, who was judicially poſſeſs'd of their Buſineſs: The Councel carryed it againſt the Biſhop, and remain'd Maſters of the Priſoners, the ſubject of this Controverſie was matter of Jurisdiction, not of Religion. The Biſhop having loſt the Cauſe, withdrew out of the City. He was ſo far from-being expell'd or driven away, that his Authority was own'd there a long time after. But diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very being made of ſeveral Conſpiracies of this Biſhop, tending to an abſolute ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, both of the Religion and Liberty of the City, being then for the moſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, his Authority at laſt expir'd in a little State he was not able to manage; the free People of it having made choice of a Religion contrary to his.</p>

                  <p>I ſay, Sir, there's no reaſon to accuſe them of Rebellion againſt their Soveraigns. 'Tis perhaps the League of <hi>Smalcald</hi> you would lay to their Charge: It was, Sir, a League defenſive only: <hi>F. Maimbourg</hi> ſhall witneſs it. They conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſays he,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Lutb. lib. <hi>3.</hi> An. <hi>1531.</hi>
                     </note> their League of mutual defence againſt all thoſe who would trouble them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Religion. The ſame Author tells us, that if the Proteſtant Princes had any deſign to prevent the Emperor, and take up Arms before him, <hi>Luther</hi> oppos'd it. And the Letter he writ on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> may be ſeen at this day at the beginning of the firſt Tome of <hi>Luthers</hi> works: Is there any thing more natural, than to unite in order to common ſafety? This League was not made by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and ſeditious Subjects, but by Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes: 'Tis very well known, the Emperor is not Maſter of the Empire, which is a Confederation of ſeveral States united under one Head, yet reſerving to themſelves-their Liberty and Soveraignty. In matters of Peace and War, Impoſitions, raiſing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all other Acts of Soveraignty, the Princes and free Towns do what they pleaſe:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97134:93"/>They make War one againſt another: They end their differences as they pleaſe, and enter, when they think fit, into Intereſts contrary to thoſe of the Emperor: If the Emperor attempt any thing againſt the Priviledges of any Member of the Empire, they remedy themſelves by Arms, without incurring the penalty or name of Rebels. Who knows not this, muſt be a ſtranger to the Hiſtory of <hi>Germany:</hi> The <hi>Golden Bull</hi> is expreſs in it. Declaring, that if the Emperor violate any Right or Priviledge belonging by that Bull to the Members of the Empire, the Princes Eccleſiaſtical and Secular have Power to oppoſe him, and cannot on that account be charg'd with Rebellion: Nor can the Proteſtants of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> be charg'd with Rebellion for entring into the League of <hi>Smalcald.</hi> Which was not more againſt the Emperor, than againſt all other who ſhould perſecute them. True it is, theſe Confederates ten years after had War with <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> but were forc'd into it: They did not take up Arms firſt, the Emperor form'd a deſign to deſtroy them, and they were oblig'd to defend themſelves: Beſides, there is nothing more falſe, than that this was properly a War of Religion. That was only a pretence by which <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. engag'd Pope <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:97134:93"/>the <hi>3d.</hi> in the League againſt the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Smalcald.</hi> The Pope indeed would have it paſs for a holy War, undertaken for the deſtruction of Hereſie. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror on the contrary publiſh'd a <hi>Manifesto,</hi> wherein he profeſſed, <hi>That the War he was entring into, was not a War of Religion: That this appear'd clearly by his permitting liberty of Conſcience to the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Princes and Souldiers, who faithfully ſerv'd him in his Armies, and that he had not entred into a League with the Pope, otherwiſe than as a Prince who aſſiſted him against the Common Enemy:</hi> 'Tis certain he had in his Army many Proteſtant Princes, particularly, <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> and <hi>Angustus</hi> Dukes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Albert</hi> and <hi>John Marqueſſes</hi> of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg. Charles</hi> whoſe Ambition knew no bounds, had no other deſign, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the liberty of the Empire, and to make it Hereditary in his Family: This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd by the conſequence of the War, wherein though he had all the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune he could hope for, he perform'd not a tittle of what he had promis'd the Pope: He endeavour'd not the deſtruction of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſm,</hi> but having taken the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Towns, put them to great Ranſoms, and drew from them vaſt Sums of Money, and huge quantities of Ammunition, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97134:94"/>left them at full liberty to profeſs what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they pleas'd. The Pope perceiving himſelfabus'd, he call'd home his Nephew and his Troops, which return'd miſerably ſcatter'd into <hi>Italy.</hi> All the Benefit he reap'd by this War, was vexation at heart, for having aſſiſted <hi>Charles</hi> to oppreſs <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and having open'd him a way for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <hi>Italy:</hi> But how can it be imagin'd, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth undertook this War out of Zeal to Religion, when, if he was of any Religion, he was perhaps more a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> than a <hi>Roman-Catholick.</hi> Which there is juſt cauſe to believe, becauſe <hi>Ponce de Leon</hi> his Confeſſor and depoſitary of his moſt ſecret thoughts, in whoſe Arms he expir'd, was condemn'd to be burnt as an <hi>Heretick</hi> by <hi>Philip</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles:</hi> I ſee on your Table, the Abridgement of the Hiſtory of <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Mezeray,</hi> the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Let us ſee, what he ſays, the laſt Age thought of it.

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:97134:94"/>5th. <hi>who attended him to his death.</hi> 'Tis no wonder he was not afraid to ſtain the Memory of his Father; for, if ſome may be credited, he was about to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation put in againſt him, and to have his bones burnt as an <hi>Heretick.</hi> And that he forbore this proceeding for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than that his Father had been an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi> he was thereby deveſted of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and conſequently, had no right to reſign them to his Son. <hi>Philip</hi> indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd a great Zealot for his Religion. But if you will believe the <hi>Germans,</hi> the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred he had againſt the Proteſtants, proceeded not ſo much from his love to the Catholick Church, as from his violent reſentment againſt the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who oppos'd the Deſign of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> to make him aſſociate of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother, whoſe Succeſſor in the Empire <hi>Philip</hi> aſpir'd to be. But to return to our Subject, I ſay, the <hi>Germans</hi> fought for their Religion and Liberty by Power inherent in the Princes of the Empire, who are as much Maſters of their States, as the Emperor of his: <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> effected what <hi>Frederick</hi> could not. He recovered the Liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> and broke the Yoke under which it groan'd. Having thus juſtifi'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97134:95"/>of <hi>Germany.</hi> I know of no other but the States of the United Provinces, who are charg'd to have chang'd their Religion, to ſet up and maintain a new form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97134:97"/>would charge us with as a Crime, have been Civil Wars, of the ſame nature with others rais'd in the Bowels of a State, by the diſcontent of the People, and the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of the great ones; to which, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was but an accidental ingredient: This, Sir, I undertake to prove evidently by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. But before I enter on that, I beg leave to make ſome Reflections: Is it not a great piece of injuſtice, in thoſe who read the Hiſtory of the laſt Age, to fix their eyes on thoſe thirty years only, which paſs'd between the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and that of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the forty years elaps'd, during the Raign of <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d?</hi> If they charge us with having been engag'd in the Civil Wars thoſe thirty years, ought they not to commend the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience we had for forty years before? Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, we were afterwards more impatient than we ought; however 'tis true, that for almoſt half an Age, we patiently endur'd unheard of Cruelties, without ſeeking any means of Revenge or Defence. During the Raigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> the Land was overflowed with our Blood, the Priſons were full of our poor Captives, the Executioners were imploy'd in nothing elſe but burning and quartering
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97134:97"/>thoſe poor Wretches, who were not guilty of any other Crime, but praying to God in a Language they underſtood, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to adore any thing, but what they knew to be God: There is no ſort of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty but was exercis'd upon them; they were burnt; they had their Members pluck'd off with hot Pinſers; they were rack'd and put to all ſorts of Tortures; they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried alive: There were horrible Maſſacres committed upon them: Such were thoſe of <hi>Cabrieres</hi> and <hi>Merindol,</hi> wherein they ras'd Houſes and Towns, laid waſte a whole Country, cut the Throats of ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Perſons, and caus'd others to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by Famine on the Mountains.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97134:98"/>then let fall into a great fire. This was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reiterated: The King was ſo pleas'd with it, that he fed his eyes with this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Spectacle: And 'tis ſaid, the horrible Cryes of one of theſe Wretches affected him ſo, that all his Life after, he was from time to time haunted with a very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome remembrance of it: I ſhould ſcarce have reported this, had the Relation been made by any Author not a <hi>Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> for it would have been look'd upon as falſe and incredible. Thoſe horrible imaginations that from time to time perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> did not reform him. His Raign was ſtain'd throughout with the Blood of his Proteſtant Subjects: In all places of the Kingdom, Fires were kindled and Gibbets ſet up to deſtroy them. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Valentinois,</hi> that King's Miſtreſs, making great advantage of the Confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Proteſtants, ſerv'd as a fury to awaken his Cruelty every moment: That laſcivious ſhe-Wolf thirſting after the blood of the Faithful, and with a ravenous Appetite coveting their Eſtates, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their death as a recompence, for thoſe criminal favours ſhe was ſo liberal of to her King and her Pages: If theſe poor People met at night in a private Houſe for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Comfort, they were ſurpriz'd,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97134:98"/>and us'd as Sorcerers found at a Sabbath adoring the Devil. To add a Perſecution more cruel then the reſt, they publiſh'd Calumnies againſt them, blacker then the Devil had ever invented; they renew'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them all the old Accuſations of the <hi>Pagans</hi> againſt the Primitive Chriſtians: They charg'd them with ſtrange Crimes, ſays <hi>Mezeray;</hi> it was ſaid, they roſted little Children,<note place="margin">

In all this time did any one take up Arms? Perhaps they were ſo weak, you will ſay, they durſt not; I am of Opinion, the Reformed were as numerous about the end of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, as at the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, when the firſt Troubles began: 'Tis not to be imagin'd, that vaſt multitude of People was converted in five or ſix months; there were at that time of the Reformed Religion, ſome Princes, ſeveral great Lords, many principal Officers of the Crown, and of the People an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>Mezeray</hi> tells us, that in one of their Meetings they ſurpriz'd ſome of the Queens Maids of Honour; yet not one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thought of making any defence
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97134:99"/>under the Reign of this Prince, who perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them with Fire and Sword: Can you wonder, that having been driven to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity by long and continual Violences, they had no more patience, but at laſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd ſome means to ſave themſelves from the fury of their Tormentors?</p>

                  <p>You know the primitive Chriſtians did not ſo; they had no other Weapons but their Prayers and Tears, to defend themſelves againſt the Perſecutions of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperors.</p>

                  <p>I wonder Sir, how thoſe of whom you have borrowed that Reflection, dare produce the Example of the Primitive Chriſtians. 'Tis true, the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had not any Arms to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor had they any to attack with: They did not burn Hereticks, but labour'd their Converſion. There is not a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Character of a falſe Church, or falſe Zeal, then Perſecution, Violence, and Fury: There have ſate on the Imperial Throne, <hi>Constantines</hi> and <hi>Theodoſii,</hi> as well as <hi>Decij</hi> and <hi>Diocletians;</hi> but a <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> or a <hi>Theodoſius</hi> never made uſe of Arms againſt the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion, which had made ſo many Martyrs: 'Tis not out of Charity alone, that Chriſtian Princes ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear attacking a falſe Religion with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97134:99"/>and torture; but out of Prudence the Church only can have Martyrs, and ought not to be robb'd of the Glory of that Priviledge, and that powerful argument for proof of her Doctrine: Nothing raiſes a greater prejudice againſt the conſtancy of true Martyrs, then the obſtinacy of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who perſiſt in their Opinions to Death. Our Accuſers, Sir, are very unjuſt in their proceeding with us; to have the Sword in one hand, and the Faggot in the other; to cover Towns and Countries with dead Bodies; to deſtroy pell-mell the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent with the Guilty; to ſhed the blood of Infants; Women and old Men having one foot in the Grave; to commit Maſſacres; to drown <hi>France</hi> with the blood of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; to Burn, Quarter, and invent new Torments: This is laudable Zeal, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the higheſt degree, that raiſes men to be Saints, equal with St. <hi>Dominick.</hi> But if a poor <hi>Hugonot</hi> lift up his Arm to put by the blow that is made at him, this is fury and rage, and the fruit of a ſpirit oppoſite to that of the true Church: I cannot forbear applying to this purpoſe, what St. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſaid to them who reproach'd him with making his Eſcape; <hi>If they think it a ſhame to me, to have made my Eſcape, let them be aſham'd to have forc'd me to it by their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:97134:100"/>When Men run away, 'tis an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Cruelty of thoſe they run from: We fly not from the Gentle and Courteous, but the Bloody and the Cruel. There is no defence where there is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. I confeſs it, Men are Men; the love of Life is ſtrong and powerful, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Counſels of fleſh and bloud prevail often over thoſe of ſtrict Piety. Were it true, that our Fathers took up Arms to ſave their Lives, 'tis a weakneſs they ought to be pardon'd for, in an Age which may very well be called an Age of Fury.</p>

                  <p>The ſame vertue, Sir, uſes a different Conduct at different times. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, were
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97134:100"/>Princes at full age and of years of Diſcretion; they acted as they thought fit, their own Faculties were their Guides, there is no doubt but God had eſtabliſh'd them for the exerciſe and tryal of his Church in her new Birth. They were Perſons of a Character, againſt which we were not permitted to lift up a hand: But <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond was a Child, a weak Child, incapable of buſineſs, and govern'd by bloudy Princes, who in his Name did what they pleas'd, and would have extirpated the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and the whole Proteſtant Party. <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth took the Scepter in hand at an Age he was as little capable to Govern as <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the ſecond: 'Tis certain, Subjects are not oblig'd to bear the Grievances done them by thoſe who uſurp and abuſe the Royal Authority, with the ſame ſubmiſſion they ought to receive the Miſeries they endure, by the ill uſe Kings make of their proper Authority. Hence it proceeds, that the Reigns of moſt of our Kings in Minority, are troubled with Civil Wars, when thoſe who have poſſeſt themſelves of the Kings Perſon, abuſe his Name, and the People think not themſelves oblig'd to ſubmit to a Tyrannical Power newly uſurp'd: We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd not nor acknowledg'd in the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> any Character that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97134:101"/>could oblige us to ſuffer their Perſecutions they declar'd and acted againſt us, much leſs could we acknowledge any ſuch Character in the Pope, his Subſtitutes, or his Clergy, the firſt Authors of our Miſeries. Theſe were our Enemies, theſe were the Party we engag'd againſt, a Party that had no right to uſe us ſo barbarouſly. 'Twas not againſt our Kings, but this ſort of People, we firſt took up Arms. True it is, our Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards to their Majority, found themſelves engag'd before-hand to proſecute our ruine; and we having our Swords in our hands, made uſe of them to avoid the violence and fury of their Miniſters. But we never wanted either Love to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Faithfulneſs in their Service: In the heat of the Civil Wars, our <hi>Hugonots</hi> had conſtantly true <hi>French</hi> hearts, and an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable Fidelity to their Kings. We are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd with the coming in of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Rheisters</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> Thoſe who introduc'd them never deſign'd to make them Maſters of the State; but I can prove it by a hundred Evidences, that the League which oppos'd us, had a deſign to take the Crown of <hi>France</hi> from the lawful Heirs, and to bring the Kingdom under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the firſt Civil Wars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, the Princes had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97134:101"/>themſelves to give <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for ſecurity: The <hi>Hugonots</hi> had no ſooner obtained Peace, but they labour'd with more Zeal then any other Subjects of <hi>France</hi> to regain the place.<note place="margin">Mez.

                     <hi>Mezeray</hi> gives you an account of it: All the <hi>French,</hi> ſays he, applyed themſelves with extraordinary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to recover the Town: The <hi>Hugonots</hi> were more forward and eager then the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> to purge themſelves from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach caſt upon them of having introduc'd Strangers into <hi>France.</hi> In the late Wars for Religion, the <hi>Rochelois</hi> reduc'd to the laſt Extremities, were ſolicited by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to yield to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and acknowledge him their Soveraign; and in caſe they would do ſo, he promis'd they ſhould be ſuccour'd in a far better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then they had been. They rejected the Propoſal with contempt, and choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to expoſe themſelves to all the Rigors of their Prince highly incens'd, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the Dominion of a Stranger: I could produce many ſuch Examples to prove that our <hi>Hugonots</hi> though in Arms were never guided by a Spirit of Rebellion, but took care only how to ſave their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and their Lives: But enough of theſe Reflections.

We will examine the Riſe and Progreſs of theſe two Parties: Their firſt riſe muſt be taken from the laſt years of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, which was after the loſs of the Battel and Town of St. <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;</hi>

Abr.</hi> Ann. 1557, 1558.</note> the old Conſtable <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> and his two Nephews, the Admiral <hi>Chatillon,</hi> and <hi>Dandelot</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were taken Priſoners there: The greateſt and braveſt of the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> being all periſh'd or made Priſoners in thoſe fatal Engagements, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Italy</hi> was look'd upon as the ſole Tutelar Angel of <hi>France.</hi> They would have given him the Title of <hi>Viceroy:</hi> But think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too ambitious, they gave him the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Kings Lieutenant-General within and without the Kingdom, which was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all the Parliaments. The Conſtable, 'tis known, was the Favourite of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97134:103"/>ſecond, who lov'd him to that degree, that after his misfortune and impriſonment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as he was, yet at his return to Court the King made him lie in his own bed. But his Abſence was fatal to him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> render'd himſelf neceſſary to the King, and as <hi>Mezeray</hi> ſays, the misfortune of <hi>France</hi> was the happineſs of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the fall of the Conſtable was his Exaltation: The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had in all his Enterprizes the ſucceſs, every one knows. He recovered <hi>Calais</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> he took <hi>Thionville;</hi> he married his <hi>Niece</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who was afterwards <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond. Fortune abandon'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and ſided with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> Read the words of <hi>Mezeray,</hi> from that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time the jealouſly between theſe two Houſes, tended to the forming two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parties in the Kingdom, as will appear. This is the firſt Seed of the Civil War, wherein Religion had not any part: Thence forward, the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> us'd all its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deſtroy <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Party. The Duke met with the pretence of Religion luckily by the way: Admiral <hi>Chatillon,</hi> and <hi>Dandelot</hi> his Brother, the Conſtables Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, were ſuſpected; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd the Suſpition, by ſaying, that at the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97134:103"/>taking of St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> they found Heretical Books amongſt <hi>Dandelots</hi> Baggage. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond being a violent Perſecuter, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be arreſted, and committed him Priſoner to <hi>Blaiſe de Montluc,</hi> a Creature of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> this was a matter agreed on by the <hi>Guiſes</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with deſign to weaken the Conſtable by the loſs of his Nephews. But they miſs'd their aim, the Conſtables favour brought <hi>Dandelot</hi> clear off, and gain'd him his Liberty: And the Authority of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, kept the two Parties in an appearance of Peace du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reſt of his life, which was not long; but in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the ſecond, the Diſcord broke out. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeray</hi> will tell you in the beginning of this Reign, the cauſe of the Civil War: <hi>A Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of</hi> Princes, ſays he, <hi>and of puiſſant Lords, is an infallible cauſe of Civil War, when there wants Authority powerful enough to keep them within the bounds of their duty:</hi> This was the misfortune of <hi>France</hi> after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. From the time of his death, the Factions form'd during his Reign, began to appear, and to fortify them the more, unhappily met with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parties in Religion; a great number of <hi>Male-Contents,</hi> who long'd for change, and, which is more, many Soldiers and Officers
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97134:104"/>of War, who having been disbanded were deſirous of Employment at any rate: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks that by this Relation, Religion is not the cauſe of the Troubles; but the cauſe of them were the Factions of Princes and great Lords, who meeting with Parties differing in Religion, made uſe of them to ſerve their deſigns. In the ſame place that Author makes it appear, the two Parties fought not for Religion but for Empire: On the one ſide were the Princes of the Bloud and the Conſtable; On the other, the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> and between both, the Regent, who by turns made uſe of one to beat down and deſtroy the other, that ſhe might Reign. The Princes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> having got into their hands the Perſon of <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, a weak Prince, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under his Authority in a tyrannical manner. The Princes of the Bloud, <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Lewis de Bourbon,</hi> who ought to have had the management of Affairs during the Kings Minority, could not endure that Strangers ſhould enjoy an Authority and Honour belonging of right and properly to them. Theſe Princes were ill us'd; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> King of <hi>Navar,</hi> came to Court, but was ſlighted, they did not ſo much as give him a Lodging, and he might have lain on the Pavement, had not the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97134:104"/>Marſhal of St <hi>Andrew</hi> receiv'd him. The Princes began with the Pen, and cauſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Writings to be publiſh'd, to make it appear that the Laws of the State admit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Women nor Strangers to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that during the Minority of the Kings, this honour belongs to the Princes of the Bloud; That the <hi>Guiſes</hi> were not natural <hi>French;</hi> that it was dangerous to commit to them the Government of the State, becauſe of their Pretenſions on the Kingdom, in ſaying, they were deſcended from <hi>Charlemaign.</hi> At laſt, <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> reſolv'd upon a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous attempt, to gain Poſſeſſion of his Rights, which the weakneſs of his Brother the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> abandon'd, and gave up to the Princes of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> He deſign'd to ſeize the Perſon of King <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, and remove the <hi>Guiſes</hi> from Court. The Admiral and <hi>Dandelot</hi> were of the Party, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was the Head: But becauſe the ſucceſs of the Enterprize was doubtful, they would not appear in it: <hi>La Renaudie</hi> was intruſted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this great deſign, which goes under the name of the Conſpiracy of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> which our Church-man, whoſe Book you have in your hand, makes ſuch a noiſe about; there cannot be a greater injuſtice then to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97134:105"/>charge our <hi>Hugonots</hi> with this Affair. 'Tis certain there were ingag'd in that buſineſs as many <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> as <hi>Hugonots;</hi> or if the number of <hi>Hugonots</hi> were greater, it was becauſe there were more <hi>Male-Contents</hi> of their Party; the Chancellor <hi>de l' Hoſpital</hi> was one. I have read in good Authors, that <hi>La Renaudie</hi> was a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> yet I will not undertake to juſtifie it: 'Tis agreed on all hands that all the Officers who had receiv'd Indignities at Court, and been unjuſtly expell'd thence, engag'd themſelves in the Enterpriſe, to be reveng'd of the Princes of <hi>Guiſe. There was at Court,</hi> ſays <hi>Mezeray, a great number of Perſons out of all the Provinces, particularly Soldiers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of War, demanding Pay or Reward. The Cardinal of</hi> Lorrain <hi>who had the management of the Finances, was much troubled with them, and apprehended a Conſpiracy in their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: This made him publiſh an Edict, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that all thoſe who followed the Court to demand any thing, ſhould retire on pain of being hang'd on a Gibbet, which was publickly ſet up for that purpoſe: A great part of thoſe who had ſerv'd in the Armies diſgusted with this Indignity, turn'd againſt the Cardinal.</hi> Thus you have an account of what perſons that Party was compos'd, which would have deſtroyed the Princes of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> where
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97134:105"/>there appears ſo ſenſible and ſo clear a cauſe of Revolt, 'tis not worth our pains to go in ſearch of a hidden one: On the one ſide, the Rights of the Princes of the Bloud, which they were reſolv'd to maintain; on the other ſide, the deſign to be reveng'd of the groſſeſt affront that ever was put on Perſons of Quality, by ſetting up a Gibbet to hang them on, for no other cauſe but that they deſir'd to be paid for the bloud they had loſt, are ſo viſibly the cauſes of this Conſpiracy, that 'tis ridiculous to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the only ground of it: The chief of all the <hi>Male-Contents</hi> was <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> And though he appear'd not in the Enterprize, and ſeveral of the Conſpirators deny'd to the Death, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing privy to it, yet 'tis certain he was. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeray</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Court, met at</hi> Orlians <hi>the Lord</hi> Cipierr, <hi>who told him the Plot was diſcovered: And that nevertheleſs the Prince continued his Journey.</hi> By this it appears, the Prince knew of the Plot. A little before, the ſame Author tells us, <hi>the Conſpirators had choſen him for their Head, but not to bear any part in the action, which was to be carryed on by</hi> La Renaude <hi>under his Authority.</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Guiſe</hi> were fully convin'd of it, for they no ſooner got the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97134:106"/>their power, but they cauſed him to be proceeded againſt, and Senten'd to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</p>

Ah, Sir, you will never be able to prove that: All our Hiſtorians bear theſe pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators Witneſs, they had no deſign againſt the King, or the Regent, but only againſt the Princes of <hi>Guiſe:</hi> Read, if you pleaſe, what <hi>Mezeray</hi> ſays. <hi>They reſolv'd to preſent their Petition to the King, and to ſeize the Duke of</hi> Guiſe <hi>and the Cardinal of</hi> Lorrain, <hi>and exhibit Articles againſt them.</hi> This was their deſign: <hi>But who,</hi> adds <hi>Mezeray, could have ſecur'd the Princes of</hi> Guiſe <hi>from being kill'd upon the ſpot, or that the</hi> Male-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents <hi>would not have made themſelves Maſters of the Perſons of the Queen Mother and the King?</hi> 'Tis certain, it was laid to their Charge, they would have attempted both.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97134:106"/>It was laid indeed to their Charge, but not prov'd; of twelve hundred Perſons who periſh'd on this occaſion, there was not one they could get to confeſs this, though uſe was made of moſt violent Tortures to force them to it. <hi>Monſieur de Thou</hi> gives them this Teſtimony:<note place="margin">Thuan.

                     <hi>Not one of the Conſpirators was convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of any attempt againſt the King or the Queen, but only against Strangers, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd all at Court in a tyrannical manner; that is, the Princes of the Houſe of</hi> Guiſe. Can you think it, Sir, ſo great a Crime for the Princes of the Bloud, and the Chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Crown, to endeavour to gain their natural places and lawful Authority, by taking forceably an Infant King (and weak, when Major) out of the hands of Tyrants, who were going to hang up his Majeſties good Servants, to eſtabliſh the Inquiſition in <hi>France,</hi> and to burn the true hearted <hi>French</hi> at the Stake? The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Admiral were, in my opinion, Names that carryed Grandeur and Authority enough in them, to oppoſe very lawfully the Tyrants of <hi>France.</hi> Your Church-man in his Book, tacks the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of <hi>Meaux</hi> to that of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> as if they were both of one nature. <hi>We are not now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in the time of the Enterprizes of</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:97134:107"/>Amboiſe <hi>and</hi> Meaux: <hi>The man hath forgot both the Author and the end of the Enterprize of</hi> Meaux: <hi>The Head of it, was the ſame Prince of</hi> Conde; <hi>the end was to remove from about the King the ſame Tyrants, who under the name of Councellors, made</hi> Charles <hi>the ninth commit Violences which exceeded thoſe in former Reigns, and to violate Edicts and Treaties, he had by ſolemn Oaths obliged himſelf to obſerve, and made uſe of the ſeeming Peace granted to the Party of the Princes, for hatching the moſt horrible and blackest Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ever have been heard of.</hi> After the firſt Civil War, the Peace was made by the Edict of the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1563. this Peace ſerv'd only as a Cloak for a Cruel War made with more ſafety againſt the Reformed after they had been diſarm'd: The Reformed made their Complaints to the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Admiral: But theſe two great great Men anſwer'd,<note place="margin">Mezeray. 1567.</note> ſays <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeray, That they must endure any thing rather than take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: That ſecond troubles would render them the horrour of all</hi> France, <hi>and make them the Object of the Kings hatred.</hi> This was their Reſolution; but when a Principal Perſon at Court had given them expreſs advice, it was reſolv'd the Prince and the Admiral ſhould be taken, the former to be kept per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97134:107"/>petual Priſoner, the other to loſe his head on a Scaffold; by the advice of <hi>Dandelot,</hi> the boldeſt of the three, they reſolv'd not only to defend themſelves, but to attack their Enemies with open force: And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto, to remove the Cardinal from the Kings Perſon. This, Sir, was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Enterprize of <hi>Meaux,</hi> and I have told you the Motives of it. I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thoſe who for this Enterprize would charge the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with Rebellion, that they would think well of it: The <hi>Hero</hi> who at this day bears the ſame name, whoſe veins are fill'd with that Illuſtrious Bloud, is an Evidence ſufficient to convince the World, we may retain our Love to our Countrey and Fidelity to our King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loving thoſe who abuſe the Infancy of our Kings, by making them Arm againſt the Liberty and Lives of the Princes of their Bloud: If the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> opened this ſecond War by the Enterprize of <hi>Meaux,</hi> it was becauſe he had not any other way to ſave his Liberty and his Life.</p>

                  <p>Well, Sir, I will, if you pleaſe, return to my Task. The firſt War was not a War of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> alone, but it was a War of <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bourbon: The two Brothers,</hi> Antony <hi>and</hi> Lewis <hi>of</hi> Bourbon, ſays <hi>Mezeray, came not to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of</hi> Melun; <hi>for two months before,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony <hi>retir'd into</hi> Gaſcoign, <hi>and his Brother went thither to him. Being then in more ſafety, they provided for their Affairs, and projected means to make themſelves able to diſlodge the</hi> Guiſes. <hi>The Deſign took wind, they were drawn to Court, and their Perſons ſecur'd; a strong Guard was plac'd on the King of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr, <hi>and the Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>impriſon'd; his Proceſs was made, and by a terrible Arreſt fram'd by the</hi> Guiſes, <hi>he was Condemn'd to loſe his Head.</hi> Was there ever ſo ſtrange and unworthy a proceeding, that Strangers ſhould Condemn to Death, the ſecond Prince of the Bloud? And can it be thought ſtrange, that a generous Prince ſhould ſeek means to be reveng'd for ſo horrible an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front? He eſcap'd miraculouſly by the death of <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, whoſe Authority the Princes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had abus'd. The King of <hi>Navarr</hi> redeem'd himſelf by yielding the Regency to the Queen: The Conſtable <hi>Montmorency</hi> fell off from the Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would have call'd him to account
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97134:108"/>for the vaſt Guifts made him by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. Then was form'd the famous Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirat between the Conſtable, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de St. Andre,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> whoſe principal deſign was to efface the Name and Memory of the Family of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon:</hi> But if the Conſtable was againſt the Princes, the Marſhal <hi>Montmorency,</hi> his Son, and Governour of <hi>Paris,</hi> was for them though a <hi>Catholick;</hi> by which it appears, that Religion was not the cauſe of thoſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: The Queen Mother ambitious to Reign abſolutely, and alone, was weary of the Tyranny of the Princes of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> And to ruine their Party, ſhe openly favour'd the Party of the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> The Queen Mother, ſays <hi>Mezeray,</hi> to reward the Services the Admiral had done her, granted or pretended to grant him aſſiſtance on ſeveral occaſions: She caus'd an Edict very favourable to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in 1562. She proceeded yet further, and cauſed the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to Arm. In this very Page, Sir, our Hiſtorian reports, that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being come to <hi>Paris</hi> with Twelve Hundred Horſe, entred the Town at the Gate of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> through which the Kings make their ſolemn Entry: The Queen perceiving his deſign to take the Government from her, writ to the Prince
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97134:109"/>of <hi>Conde,</hi> then retired to his Houſe, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending very affectionately to him, her Son, the Kingdom, and her ſelf. If you look upon the following Page, you will ſee ſhe ſent for the Prince, who having got all his Friends together, took his Journey to go to the Queen, and paſs'd the <hi>Seine</hi> at St. <hi>Clou.</hi> This, Sir, was the firſt taking up Arms, and the beginning of the firſt War; which was kindled by the Diviſions of the great ones, and the unhappy policy of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin de Medicis.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſent to the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> the Original Letters of the Queen Mother, wherein ſhe pray'd him to deliver her and the King out of Captivity: The Regent who put Arms into the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s hands, reap'd not the benefit ſhe expected from them, but was retained in ſlavery with the young King, by the Tyranny of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> and carried to <hi>Paris</hi> againſt her will. Can you wonder, that a Prince of the Bloud, of great Courage, and in Arms at the Requeſt of the Queen, ſhould purſue his point, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be reveng'd of the <hi>Guiſes</hi> who had almoſt brought his Head to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold? Can you think it ſtrange? The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> immediately made themſelves of the Party of a Prince of the Bloud, who had ſo juſtly taken up Arms to defend himſelf
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97134:109"/>from the horrible Violences and Outrages of his Enemies; for then was the time, Sir, when the Maſſacres of <hi>Vaſſy, Seus, Auxeure, Cahoy, Tours,</hi> and a hundred other places were perpetrated: Then it was, that the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> paſs'd an Arreſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they gave order the <hi>Hugonots</hi> ſhould be kill'd whereever they were found. It was not <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond commanded theſe Cruelties, but the Tyrants, who abuſed the Authority of an Infant King: Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality doth not Condemn a lawful defence againſt thoſe who unjuſtly attack us.</p>

Can you approve of what was done at <hi>Orange?</hi> Where ſome were kill'd with many gentle blows of Ponyards, that they might be the longer a dying; others were Impall'd; ſome Burnt; others Saw'd; Women were hang'd at the Windows, and the Infants out of their Boſoms daſh'd againſt the walls; the old Men being drawn up in rank, to ſee this horrible Spectacle before they were Maſſacred. This is not the thouſandth part
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97134:110"/>of Actions I could relate like theſe. The Anſwer of the Baron of <hi>Adrets</hi> to thoſe of our Party, who reproached him for his Cruelty, was; <hi>'Tis not Cruelty to be Cruel to them who have first been cruel to us; the firſt is called Cruelty, the ſecond, Juſtice:</hi> And to clear himſelf of the Imputation, he reckon'd up many thouſands who had been kill'd in cold bloud, and put to Tortures never heard of before: When you have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify'd all this, I will undertake the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Breakers of Images and Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Churches. I have ſomething more to ſay to you. Be ſo kind to juſtify the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are ſo <hi>Catholick</hi> and ſo devoted to the Holy See; make us a little Apology for what they did at <hi>Rome,</hi> when taken by <hi>Charles de Bourbon,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. Let's look into <hi>Fa. Maimbourgs</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> which I ſee on your Table: He will tell you, Sir, theſe good <hi>Catholicks</hi> were Cruel and Prophane beyond Example in Hiſtory. 'Tis impoſſible, ſays he, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all the Outrages committed in that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Pillage: It infinitly exceeds in all ſort of Crimes, what the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> heretofore did when they ſack'd <hi>Rome;</hi> nothing was ſpar'd but Deformity and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: All things elſe became the prey of a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97134:111"/>Conqueror, the moſt brutiſh that ever was. If you pleaſe to read on, you will find that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> by the relation of their own Hiſtorians, were more cruel and covetous then the <hi>German Lutherans.</hi> To conclude, if you will undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all that hath been done by your <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> in Wars for Religion, I will intreat you to juſtify the horrible Enormities committed in the Eaſt by thoſe <hi>Croiſado</hi>'s who left their Countries, their Eſtates and their Children, to go and adore the Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt, and recover the Holy Land out of the hands of Infidels. I muſt intreat you to hear the reading of a Paſſage out of the <hi>Byzantine</hi> Hiſtory, which I tranſlated laſt night, foreſeeing I ſhould have occaſion to make uſe of it in my defence on this Article to day.<note place="margin">Nicitas Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates <hi>in the Life of</hi> Alexius Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas.</note> Into what Method ſhall I digeſt the horrible Crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Execrable Men? Shall I begin with their Outrages on the venerable Images they trod under foot; or thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the Reliques of Holy Martrys, which they threw into the naſtyeſt places? Or ſhall I ſpeak of that which is as horrible at this day to hear, as thoſe were to ſee at the time they were acted? The Divine Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of our Saviour were ſplit on
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97134:111"/>the ground and thrown in the dirt; thoſe who could ſeize the rich Caſes the ſacred Veſſels were put in, ſecur'd the Veſſels in their Pockets, and made uſe of the Caſes for Cups and Trenchers. True fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> acting before hand what he ſhould commit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In pillaging the Churches, the Holy Veſſels were their prey; and the Mules and Beaſts of burden were brought to the Church doors; where, the Pavement being ſlippery, they often fell and bruiſed themſelves to death, ſo that the holy places were defil'd with the Bloud and Dung of thoſe Beaſts: Amidſt all theſe Diſorders, to the greater affront of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there ſate on the ſeat of the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> a Woman laden with Sins, a Miniſter of Furies, a Servant of Devils, and Miſtreſs of Sorceries, Inchantments and Poyſonings, ſinging Impure Songs, and dancing Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Dances: Hear the Authors Reflection: <hi>'Tis evident, theſe People abuſe us, in ſaying they are going to Conquer the Holy Sepulchre of Chriſt, when they diſcharge all their fury against Chriſt himſelf, and with the Croſs they carry on their Shoulders, violate and profane the Croſs of Chriſt, for a little Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> Now, Sir, if you pleaſe, you will yield me up theſe Saints and Devout <hi>Croiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>'s as not to be juſtify'd in the Actions I

                  <p>The ſum of all, is this, Sir, That theſe Wars were not originally Wars of Religion, but Wars of State: Wars, to which the two Factions of <hi>Montmorency</hi> and <hi>Guiſe</hi> had given birth; Wars, wherein the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> were of contrary Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well as the <hi>Hugonots:</hi> For you ſee (in the purſuit as in the beginning of the War) the chief Roman Catholick Families of the Kingdom, engag'd in the Party of the Princes of the Bloud, and put into the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97134:113"/>Liſt of thoſe whoſe Throats were to be cut: The Marſhals <hi>Montmorency</hi> and <hi>Coſſe,</hi> and <hi>Biron</hi> Grand Maſter of the Artillery, were no <hi>Hugonots:</hi> Yet <hi>Mezeray</hi> tells you, they were in the Liſt of thoſe who were to be Maſſacred at <hi>Bartholomew-Tide:</hi> That the Marſhal <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s being at <hi>Chantilly</hi> abſent from Court, ſav'd the Life of his three Brothers: That <hi>Coſſe</hi> was ſav'd by the Interceſions of <hi>Madame Chateau Neuf Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Mistreſs;</hi> and that <hi>Biron</hi> Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Artillery, ſav'd himſelf, by pointing ſome <hi>Culverins</hi> towards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was not the Zeal of Religion only animated theſe Furies, but Avarice, and Ambition, and a deſire to Reign without a Rival: Hence it came, that a great number of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks were Butchered with the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> Read <hi>Mezeray</hi>'s words: <hi>This Deluge of bloud, ſwept away abundance of Catholicks, who were diſpatch'd by order of the Soveraign Powers, or the inſtigation of private Perſons.</hi> To have Money, or a good Office, or a revengeful Enemy, or an Heir longing to be in poſſeſſion, was to be a <hi>Hugonot:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> as great a Catholick as he was, ſav'd, during the Maſſacre, above a hundred <hi>Hugonots</hi> in his Palace, whom he thought he could gaint o his Service. Had all the <hi>Hugonots</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:97134:114"/>been willing to have plac'd him on the Throne, as he thought thoſe hundred were, he would have ſav'd a Million of them, and would have been their great friend and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. So true is it, that the Ambition of the great ones, was the cauſe of theſe Wars on the one ſide and the other: Hath not the Duke of <hi>Alanſon</hi> Brother of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, been ſeen at the head of Thirty Thouſand of theſe Male-Contents? Yet he was no <hi>Hugonot,</hi> nor ever favour'd them of the Religion: Were not Marſhal <hi>Danville</hi> and ſeveral other firm and profeſt Roman Catholicks engag'd for the ſame Party? By which it appears, all thoſe Wars were the Wars of the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in general, whether <hi>Catholicks</hi> or <hi>Hugonots.</hi> To Conclude, Sir, for juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Hugonots</hi> in theſe Wars, I can prove they had not any deſign but to preſerve themſelves, the State, and the Illuſtrious Princes of the <hi>Family</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> now Regnant: On the contrary, the oppoſite Party was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, who covered their Deſigns with the Specious Vail of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but were Enemies to the State, and would have put the Crown upon the Heads of Strangers.</p>

                  <p>Sir, that which hath been ſaid by us on this Subject, is not the hundredth part of what may be ſaid to prove, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which call'd it ſelf the Holy Union, and went under the name of the <hi>League</hi> from the year 1576. to the year 1600. was altogether <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and an Enemy to the State; and that our Party which was wholly oppoſite to the other, was altogether <hi>French.</hi> But I will comply with your deſires, and ſay no more of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you will in requital anſwer a queſtion I am going to ask you. What reaſon you Gentlemen of the Roman Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion have to Condemn the <hi>Protestants</hi> for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97134:115"/>their pretended Rebellions againſt their Princes, on the account of Religion?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Par.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis on this Ground: That Subjects owe abſolute obedience to their Soveraign's in all things: That the Soveraign is Maſter of the Religion of his Countrey: And that Subjects have no right to demand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of a Religion different from that of the State.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hug. Law.</speaker>
                  <p>You have anſwered juſt as I expected: And according to theſe Maxims you argue very right: For if a Prince is abſolute Maſter of the Religion of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as of other their Concerns; if Subjects are obliged to follow always the Religion of their Soveraign, doubtleſs there is reaſon to charge them with Rebellion, who with Arms in their hands, deſire to be tolerated in the Exerciſe of a Religion different from that of the State. But, Sir, have you thought well of the Maxim you propos'd? Do you remember 'tis the Maxim of <hi>Hobbs</hi> in his <hi>Politicks?</hi> You know how famous <hi>Spinoſa</hi> was for Impiety: He was for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one Liberty to think and ſpeak what he pleas'd concerning Religion, yet attributes to the Soveraign an abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Religion of the State: You know theſe two men are an Object of Execration to all Divines, and that they are
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97134:115"/>generally look'd upon as great Enemies of Religion: And amongſt all their Maxims, this in particular hath been look'd upon as one of the moſt Pernicious: Conſider a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, how far it may be carry'd: If the Prince be Maſter of Religion, you <hi>Catholicks</hi> muſt be Reformed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſo muſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Swede,</hi> and the Chriſtians of the Eaſt muſt turn <hi>Mahometans</hi> in <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Turkey:</hi> If therefore this may peradventure be a falſe Maxim, as certainly it is, is it ſo great a Crime to be of a Religion different from that of the State? And if you are of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion different from that of your Prince, is it a Crime to obtain from him a toleration to exerciſe it in private or publick.</p>

                  <p>Either you miſapprehend me, or I have not well expreſs'd my ſelf: I deſign not to aſſert, the Empire of Kings extends to the Conſcience, or that they are Maſters of the Religion of the heart: I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well we are to obey God rather than Men: I coufeſs it allowable, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to be of a Religion different from that of our Prince: In a word, 'tis no Crime to deſire permiſſion of the Prince to make publick profeſſion of a Religion different from his: My meaning was, that the Prince is Maſter of the External part of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97134:116"/>Religion: That if he will not permit any Religion but his; when we cannot obey, we may die patiently without making other defence than our Sufferings: Becauſe true Religion ought not to make uſe of force and Arms for its eſtabliſhment: Princes are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to blame when they violently oppoſe the Eſtabliſhment of the true Religion, but they are, anſwerable only to God for it.</p>

                  <p>In this ſence, I confeſs, your Maxim is pious, and bears the Character of the Primitive Chriſtian Morality: And now, Sir, I have you where I wiſh'd you: I ask you with confidence, what ground you <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have to charge us with the violation of this Maxim? If you think it good, why d' you not obſerve it? If you obſerve it not, why make you ſuch ado, why clamour you ſo much againſt others, who do not obſerve it? You may very well be allow'd, Gentlemen, to make the like Objection againſt the Reformed. You, who are of a Religion, whoſe Hiſtory, if written, would be a continual Series of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt Soveraigns, of Attempts againſt their Authority, Conſpiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Lives, and Aſſaſſinations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon their Perſons, for the ſake of Religion, and under pretence of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97134:116"/>it. You know the Hiſtory of paſt Ages and the preſent, and cannot be ignorant that when a Prince meddles never ſo little with what you call the Eſtate, the Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges of the Church, though theſe things concern not the grounds of Religion, he is call'd impious, an Heretick, and a favourer of Hereticks, and permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is given to rebel againſt him. For an Abby; for the Revenues of a Biſhoprick ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the hands of a Prince; for the Rights of Regale; for Nomination to ſome Benefices what a buſtle is made, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Inſolences are not committed? According to that pious Maxim upon which you ground your Charge againſt us, and ſo cruelly proſecute it; thoſe who labour for the maintenance of Religion, are to be meerly patient, and ought not to make uſe of any means that may diminiſh or indanger the Authority of the Prince. But will you caſt your eye upon the Conduct of the League, that <hi>Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> which in 1576. appear'd under that name for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith? You will ſee how they obſerv'd this Maxim. The firſt honour Monſieur <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeray</hi> does them,<note place="margin">Mez. Abr. <hi>1576.</hi>
                     </note> is to call them a great Faction, and the firſt Atchievement he attributes to them, is, that they had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97134:117"/>the Royal Authority. In a ſhort time, ſays he, it was evident, this Faction having taken root in almoſt all the Provinces, put forth Branches ſo high, it cover'd and almoſt ſtifl'd the Authority Royal: 'Twas this League engag'd the whole Kingdom into a Party, whereof the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was the Head, and made the <hi>French</hi> ſign a Treaty of Union againſt the Authority of their lawful Prince. 'Twas this League forc'd <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> to ſign at the States of <hi>Blois</hi> this <hi>Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> So that from King, ſays <hi>Mezeray,</hi> he became the head of a Cabal, and inſtead of being the common Father, declar'd himſelf an Enemy of one part of his Subjects. 'Twas this League, which in derogation of the Royal Authority, went to ſtab the Favorites of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> almoſt in his boſome. And that poor Prince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd of his authority, took pleaſure and comfort in erecting Statues, and ſetting up Monuments for thoſe they had robb'd him of by their barbarous aſſaſſinations: 'Twas this League endeavour'd by all means to render <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> odious, by inſolent Sermons, by Confeſſions, wherein the Monks inſpir'd their Penitents with an averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Prince, and impos'd on them for Penance, a neceſſity to hate him. 'Twas this League,<note place="margin">1584.</note> ſays <hi>Mezeray,</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:97134:117"/>which having heated the Zealous, ſtirred the Factious, and perſwaded the Princes, began to riſe, to Liſt Soldiers, to make Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, to chooſe Chiefs, at whoſe Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by Billet, though they own'd not themſelves Heads of the Party, thoſe who were Liſted were oblig'd to repair to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of Rendezvouz. 'Twas this <hi>Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> treated the ſame year with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and made a League Offenſive and Defenſive to Exclude from the Crown its Lawful Heirs. 'Twas this League ſeiz'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings Authority all the Towns it could take in the Kingdom: And not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that, would have had permiſſion from <hi>Rome,</hi> to attempt the King's Life, and for that end made <hi>Fa. Matthew</hi> the Jeſuit take ſo many Journeys, that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the Courier of the League: Compare this deſign with the Enterprizes of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> and <hi>Meaux,</hi> and ſee which is the more Criminal. Our <hi>Protestants</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd for having endeavour'd to free our Kings from the ſlavery they were kept in by Princes Strangers, yet you are well pleas'd that the ſame Princes Strangers ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their Lives: 'Twas this League brought the <hi>Rheiters</hi> into <hi>France</hi> in 1585.<note place="margin">1588.</note> 'Twas this League unworthily chas'd away their King from his Capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:97134:118"/>at the Barricade of <hi>Paris,</hi> and obliged him to ſave himſelf by night in great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he might eſcape being ſhut up in a Cloſter, ſhorn a Monk, perpetually Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, and perhaps Murder'd. 'Twas this League call'd their Prince Tyrant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated him, blotted his Name out of the publick Prayers, and caus'd Arms to be taken up againſt him on all ſides, after the death of the Princes of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> In fine, 'twas this Holy League made for the preſervation of the Catholick Faith, that aſſaſſinated the King at St. <hi>Clou,</hi> by the hands of a <hi>Jacobin</hi> Monk.

'Tis not neceſſary, the memory of it is freſh, and all the World knows it: When you have recollected what you have heard, I cannot tell whether you will think it prudent in a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> to hit us ſo confidently in the teeth with that Maxim; that Religion ought not to be defended by Arms; and that under pretence of Religion, nothing ought to be done that may any way hurt the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority.</p>

                  <p>Sir, give me leave to tell you, this Invective is unjuſt: You charge our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with the Crimes of particular men:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97134:118"/>Do you believe the actions of the League were agreeable to the Principles of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion?</p>

                  <p>If I did you injuſtice in that point, I did but requite you in kind for the like injuſtice you had done us: For you would make our Religion anſwerable for all the diſorders happen'd forty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Civil Wars of <hi>France,</hi> the laſt Age. Were it true, that Motives of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion only had engag'd the Reformed in thoſe Wars, yet thoſe Diſorders ought not to be imputed to the Reformed Religion, whoſe Doctrine perſwades not, nor inclines men to Revolt. But I affirm it, Sir, I do your Religion no wrong, if I lay to its charge all the Diſorders and furious Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the League. Becauſe the Pope the Head and Author of your Religion was the Author and Promoter of that League; becauſe there were publick Rejoyceings at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Te Deum</hi> ſung for the <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maean</hi> Maſſacre: The Sieur <hi>du Maurier,</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Memoirs of <hi>Holland</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that there is to be ſeen this day at <hi>Rome</hi> a piece of Picture, wherein is drawn the Maſſacre of the Admiral, with theſe words, <hi>Pontifex probat Colinij necem;</hi> the Pope approves of the killing of <hi>Coligny.</hi> This Maſſacre was committed before the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97134:119"/>League was hatch'd, and openly own'd, though it was then form'd, and acted with a furious vigor: The aſſaſſinate of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> was approv'd by the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Publick Elogies were made in praiſe of him who committed the Aſſaſſinate, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Invectives againſt him that was murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; this Prince, as well as <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> his Succeſſor, was Excommunicated by the Pope: Their Subjects were abſolv'd from their Oaths of Allegiance, and all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Europe</hi> rais'd againſt them. All this, Sir, may we juſtly impute to your Religion, becauſe the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Divinity ſpread throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize theſe Rebellions againſt Princes, when the great Article of your Religion is concern'd; which is, <hi>Obedience to the Pope.</hi> 'Tis the Pope aſſumes a power to deprive Kings of their Crowns, and to transfer their Eſtates to others; 'Tis the Pope authorizes the aſſaſſinates of Kings and ſacred Perſons, when theſe facts are perpetrated purſuant to their Bulls of Depoſition; 'tis the Pope uſurps the temporal Eſtate of the Emperour in <hi>Italy,</hi> and under pretence that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours had loſt their Right by Hereſy, made himſelf Soveraign of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis the Pope ſtiles himſelf Superiour to Kings, and makes Crown'd heads ſtoop to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97134:119"/>kiſs his feet; 'tis the Pope trod on the necks of Emperors, applying to himſelf thoſe words, <hi>The young Lion and the Adder ſhalt thou tread under thy feet;</hi> 'tis the Pope hath drown'd <hi>Germany</hi> with bloud, arming the Father againſt the Son, and the Son a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Father, to force from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours the right of Inveſtiture into the great Benefices. The times are much altered ſince the Popes call'd themſelves the Emperours moſt humble Servants, and ſaid they were but duſt and aſhes in their preſence: I ſee there the Works of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, and could let you ſee in them the Style of the Popes in thoſe days, when they writ to the Emperours; but I had rather let you ſee it in the Margin of Father <hi>Maimbourgh</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Lutheraniſm:</hi> You will allow me who am a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> the pleaſure (which is not ſmall) to take out of the Margin of a Jeſuits Book thoſe words of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> which the Miniſters have ſo often quoted;<note place="margin">Hiſt.

This vexes you, Sir, as it pleaſes us; I confeſs our joy may be tax'd of ſome malice but 'tis a matter ſo rare and ſo ſingular to hear a profeſt Jeſuit, and one under the fourth vow, ſpeak thus of a Pope, you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us for being pleas'd with it; but the days are long ſince gone, when they ſpoke thus at <hi>Rome:</hi> The Popes have ſince thoſe days aſſum'd and exercis'd a Power to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Emperours and Kings, to declare them Tyrants, to raiſe their Subjects againſt them, when they do any thing the Popes pretend to be contrary to Religion: This is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo publickly notorious, it hath been prov'd a hundred times. Now Sir, I will dare your <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to charge us with our pretended Rebellions, and having maintain'd our Religion by Arms; and give me leave to tell you, I wonder the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your Churchman, and the intereſt of his Party, permitted him to renew the memory of our Wars for Religion; for he might have eaſily foreſeen, we would not fail to expoſe to publick view ſo many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Conſpiracies thoſe of his Character and Religion every day plot and carry on
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:97134:120"/>in thoſe Countreys where the Supremacy of the Pope is not acknowledg'd: If we acted a part in the Civil Wars of <hi>France,</hi> they cannot reproach us with having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd the murder of our Princes, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſaſſinated them. We have never been charg'd with having deſign'd and endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to blow up with powder a whole State in a moment, not only the head but all its principal Members: We are now under great Sufferings in <hi>France;</hi> but amidſt all our Sufferings, we glory that our very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies bear witneſs of our Fidelity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; but the Martyrs of your Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thoſe poor <hi>Catholicks,</hi> he laments and bewails, that they are cruelly put to death in <hi>England,</hi> under pretence of a pretended Conſpiracy, are ſufficiently convicted to have been tampering with as horrible an Enterprize as any hath been deſign'd this Age.</p>

                  <p>We have done with that, Sir, let's hear no more of it, I pray, whether the <hi>Engliſh Catholicks</hi> be guilty or not, let not us inquire further; this Gentleman hath ſaid as much on that Subject as you can; do not attack us, you will find work enough to defend your ſelves; you think you have ſaid enough, but you have not ſpoken a word of the laſt Wars you rais'd in the

                  <p>As to the Plot in <hi>England,</hi> you ſhall not ſcape ſo; you ſhall hear a great deal more of it, if you pleaſe; I know all this Gentleman ſaid to you of it, he told you what he knew, but not all that may be known of it; ſuch order is taken to hinder the tranſportation of authentick Copies of the Tryals of thoſe Criminals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Foreign parts, we ſcarce know any thing of them; ſo that you are not to admire this Gentleman ſeem'd not throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed: But becauſe that formidable Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet you took out of your pocket, charges us to have occaſion'd a Perſecution againſt the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> under pretence of a pretended Conſpiracy, you muſt allow us to juſtify our ſelves a little more fully, and to add to what we have ſaid, what is ſince come to our knowledge; but, If you pleaſe, I will firſt ſpeak a word or two to the laſt Wars of Religion in <hi>France</hi> about the beginning of this Age: I am for plain dealing, I will never call evil good, nor good evil; I am of their number who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve of theſe Wars, nor make it their buſineſs to juſtify them. The places of ſafety which had been given us were the ſeeds of this War; the King was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97134:121"/>to have them put into his hands, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were obſtinately bent to retain them: It was ill done, without doubt they ought to have reſtor'd them, and to have rely'd on the Providence of God and the King's Juſtice. Yet this we have to ſay for our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, 'Tis not juſt to charge a whole body of men with that which was done but by a part: Perhaps three fourths of all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> were for a Submiſſion: Theſe doubtleſs would have carry'd it both for Number and Prudence, but they were the weakeſt of the Party: The turbulent Spirits were Maſters of all their Forces and Arms.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſay the Religion of great men keeps them not from being ambitious: They reign in Confuſions, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves formidable by raiſing Troubles, they abuſe the ſimplicity of the People, and make them pay for the Follies and Crimes of thoſe who abuſe them: This was one cauſe of the laſt Wars; we had great men of our perſwaſion, who being in the head of a great Party, made themſelves formidable at Court for the ſtrong places they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of. Theſe men foreſaw that by the change of Affairs deſign'd at Court, their Credit and their Penſions would be loſt;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97134:122"/>they did all they could to bear up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and engag'd in their Quarrel the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Zeal is always ſufficiently igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ill enough guided. Methinks ſome charity ought to be had for people who have no ill intention, but only the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to permit themſelves to be ſeduc'd, by miſtaking intereſts of Religion: It muſt be conſidered alſo that moſt of thoſe who took Arms were frightned into it: Our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies who deſir'd nothing more than to ſee us riſe, that they might take that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deſtroy us, caus'd Rumors to be ſpread, that there was a deſign to maſſacre all the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> that it was agreed by a ſecret Article in the Treaty of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the Marriages lately made: The preſſing ſo earneſtly to have again into the King's hands the places of ſtrength given by his Father to the <hi>Protestants,</hi> heightned our ſuſpicion. The horrible Image of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres and Torments of the laſt Age, was freſh in memory; many had been Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſome had been Sufferers in thoſe horrible Tragedies. The fear of ſeeing like days again drove them out of their Wits, and hurried them into a deſign to prevent Calamities that appear'd otherwiſe inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: This is a truth to which the late King of glorious memory bears witneſs in his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:97134:122"/>Declaration of the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1615. And that great Prince found in that Source of the War, a reaſon to excuſe it. When he ſays, <hi>The poor people having too lightly believ'd there were deſignes againſt their Lives, had precipitated themſelves into this Enterprize, thinking themſelves forc'd into it for their juſt and lawful defence:</hi> Beſides, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with what Spirit our <hi>Protestants</hi> were animated in the laſt Wars, you will find ſome cauſe to excuſe them; perhaps there was in their Conduct ſomewhat of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that Governour who writ to <hi>Tiberias, The Empire is yours, my Government is mine.</hi> That is, they were jealous of their Liberties and Priviledges to that degree, they would not have them infring'd in the leaſt; but you cannot with juſtice charge them to have been animated with a Spirit of Contempt, or hatred, or revolt againſt their Soveraign. All their deſign was to Cantonize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to preſerve their Religion; this only excepted, they were always ready to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all for the Grandeur of their King and the good of the State: This is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd more than once by the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Hiſtorians. After all, theſe Troubles ended about threeſcore years ſince cannot be at this day a lawfull Cauſe for revoking the Edicts of Pacification; becauſe our
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:97134:123"/>Kings have defac'd the memory of thoſe Troubles by ſo many Declarations, and have confirmed by their Royal words fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſolemnly given us, the favours they had granted us. Good God! where is that integrity? what's become of that ſincerity and good faith men ought to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice? Will they never call to mind that there is in Heaven a God faithful to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, who threatens vengeance on thoſe who violate Treaties and Alliances?</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen, I cannot endure you ſhould make ſuch a noiſe about pretended breaches of words. Is not a King always Maſter of his Arreſts and Declarations? Is any thing more ordinary than to ſee that revok'd at one time which hath been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd at another? Is a Prince charg'd to have dealt falſly or deceitfully when he charges or revokes ſome Laws he had made?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hug. Law.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me intreat you, Sir, not to permit your ſelf to be miſled and impos'd upon by that ſorry argument ſo often brought againſt us: Conſider, I pray, there is a great deal of difference between Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Laws, or Regulations of Proceedings in Suits Criminal or Civil, and Treaties <hi>bonâ fide</hi> made with Subjects, and People who are or enter under the Dominion of a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:97134:123"/>Prince. A Soveraign may revoke Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Laws and alter the forms of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which have been heretofore, but are not now uſeful to the State, becauſe they are not Treaties; he made not theſe Laws irrevocable, he was not engag'd, he did not promiſe any he would not revoke them, but in the Edicts of Pacification, our Kings treated with Men in the preſence of God, they engag'd themſelves to allow them ſome Liberties and preſerve them: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd this ſolemnly without reſerving a Power of Revocation. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, but the Councel of <hi>France</hi> is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally blam'd, for looking upon all Treaties made with thoſe who are, or enter under the King's Dominion as Toys to play with and deceive the ſimple, and falſe Dice to cheat thoſe who mean honeſtly and act fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For thoſe many years the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces have had in their ſubjection <hi>Bolduc</hi> and <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> Cities wherein the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have all manner of Liberty, and the Burgeſſes great Priviledges, they have not fail'd to obſerve to a tittle the Treaties and Capitulations agreed on. I heard read the other day the Record of what was tranſacted upon the voluntary ſurrender of <hi>Sedan</hi> to the King: There cannot be a thing fairer than the Priviledges the King grants
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:97134:124"/>to the Town and the Religion then predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant there: Nothing more ſolemn than the manner of their mutual engagement, by an Oath of Fidelity on the Subjects part, and on the part of the Soveraign, by the Liberties he allows them; but the memory of all this is vaniſh'd. When we mention theſe Treaties at Court, all the anſwer we have is, <hi>The King's mind is alter'd.</hi> This Conduct (which is obſerv'd in matters of State as well as of Religion) does <hi>France</hi> a greater injury than can be imagin d; it renders the <hi>French</hi> Government intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at a time when <hi>France</hi> would have it appear the moſt eaſy: The People of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and the <hi>Franche Comte</hi> lately conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, retain to this day an affection for <hi>Spain,</hi> and groan under a Yoke which is not at preſent very heavy; 'tis becauſe they know the Priviledges and Liberties they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, ſhall not laſt long; there is more danger than you think of in this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; for the World never wants ſome Factious Spirits who mind not that other mens ſins cannot juſtify or excuſe them in theirs; they forget that the faults of Princes againſt their Subjects do not authorize Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to rebel againſt their Princes; they frequently ſay to one another, <hi>We are not obliged to keep our words with him that breaks
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97134:124"/>his with us: Fregit fidem, frangatur ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi> You ſee you have carry'd us a great way from the place we were at; but you will think it fit, Sir, that we return thither again, and ſpeak now of the Conſpiracy in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>'Tis for that very reaſon, Sir, we return ſo often to that Subject.

                  <p>Sir, before we enter on this buſineſs, I pray I may be allow'd to make my Confeſſion: I confeſs that the laſt year when I diſcours'd this Gentleman about our affairs, I was not throughly inform'd of the State of thoſe in <hi>England:</hi> For inſtance, I ſaid, <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi> were not turn'd <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;</hi> I have ſince learnt the contrary, and that they turn'd <hi>Proteſtants</hi> aſſoon as they had given in their Depoſitions; being convinc'd by our Divines, that Religion which authorized ſuch deſigns, could not be the true. But I pretend not that this doth in the leaſt invalidate their Teſtimony, they were the honeſter men for turning <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but let them have been of what Religion they will, if they believe there is a God and a Hell, 'tis not imaginable they could be ſo deſperately wicked to damn themſelves in a frolick, by inventing ſo long and horrible a ſtory againſt millions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent people: And as I was ill inform'd concerning the Religion of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> I was no better inform'd, as to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Witneſſes who made Oath in that buſineſs. Of all the Tryals of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators having read only two or three, I knew none of the Witneſſes but thoſe two againſt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97134:126"/>whom the Jeſuits of St. <hi>Omers</hi> publiſh'd ſo many Libels. I ſaid not a word to you of the Depoſitions of <hi>Prance, Dugdale, Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon, Dangerfield,</hi> and ſeveral others; and the truth is, they endeavour to perſwade us on this ſide the Sea, that all this great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair hangs only on the Teſtimony of two pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Raſcals; but by the Tryals of the other Conſpirators, we have ſeen the Depoſitions of <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who ſaid he had ſeen a Letter of <hi>Whitebread,</hi> Provincial of the Jeſuits in <hi>England,</hi> wherein he advis'd one of the Conſpirators, to make choice of bold and deſperate men to execute the deſign, and that it matter'd not whether they were Gentlemen or not: This <hi>Dugdale</hi> hath ſworn he was engag'd into the Plot by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> and ſeveral others; that he knew of ſeveral Meetings at <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> at <hi>Tixal,</hi> and other places, where my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> my Lord <hi>Peters, Leviſon,</hi> and many others were preſent to find out a means to deſtroy the King and ſet up Popery; that afterwards <hi>Harcourt</hi> the Jeſuit, made choice of him to be one of the Aſſaſſins; and that <hi>Gavan</hi> another Jeſuit, had often endeavor'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him it was not only lawful but meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to kill any one for the advancement of Religion; that he fetch'd proofs out of Scripture, and inſtanc'd <hi>Garnet</hi> for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:97134:127"/>whoſe Reliques had wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and that he aſſur'd him he ſhould be Canoniz'd for this action. If this be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the Tryals of <hi>Barriere, John Guignard, John Chatell, and Ravillac,</hi> and with the Hiſtory of <hi>Garnet</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, whom they have made a Martyr; and you reflect upon the Chamber of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into which the Jeſuits put them, they would prepare for ſuch extraordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it will appear this Evidence hath not the ayr of fiction, and that nothing is more agreeable to the ordinary Conduct and Principles of the Jeſuits. The ſame man ſwears, <hi>Harcourt</hi> the Jeſuit was the firſt gave him the news of Sir <hi>Edmundbury-Godfrey</hi>'s death, in theſe words, <hi>This night Sir</hi> Edmundbury-Godfrey <hi>hath been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd.</hi> In <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Tryal he ſays that <hi>Ewers</hi> the Jeſuite had differ'd with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Murder of <hi>Godfrey: Dugdale</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told the Jeſuit, he would be hang'd if this ſpoil'd not the whole buſineſs, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit anſwer'd, that <hi>Godfrey</hi> was a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of Night-walkers and lewd people, and it would be eaſily believ'd one of them had murder'd him in revenge. In the ſame Tryal he depoſes, that in the Conferences the Jeſuits of the Plot had with him, he learnt they were to have an Army in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97134:127"/>for a Maſſacre when they had aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King; that once they were in a mind to begin with the Maſſacre, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alter'd the project: In <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s Tryal the ſame Witneſs depoſes further, that my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had promis'd to pay him before-hand five hundred Pounds Sterling, to kill the King with Piſtol, Ponyard, or otherwiſe; that <hi>Ewers</hi> the Jeſuit when he ſhewd him <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Letter, which brought the news of <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Death, ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Godfrey <hi>was grown a little too inquiſitive, and that they had done well in killing him. Prance</hi> another Witneſs depoſes, <hi>That</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court <hi>the</hi> Jeſuit <hi>paying him for an Image of the Virgin, told him there was a Plot against the King's Life; that</hi> Fenwick, Ireland, <hi>and</hi> Grove <hi>had ſaid in his preſence, there ſhould be in readineſs an Army of fifty thouſand men to eſtabliſh the Catholick Religion; and that my Lords,</hi> Powis, Bellaſis, <hi>and</hi> Arundel <hi>were to command it.</hi> That when <hi>Prance</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd the poor Tradeſmen would be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, and have nothing to do in a time of War; it was anſwer'd, <hi>He need not trouble himſelf for that, he ſhould have imployment enough, to make Images for the Churches.</hi> The ſame Witneſs in the Tryals of <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> gives in his Depoſition the whole Story of the Murder of <hi>Godfrey:</hi> He ſays, <hi>That to agree the manner of that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97134:128"/>they had ſeveral Meetings at an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe at the ſign of the</hi> Plow; <hi>that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd much to perſwade him it was no Crime to kill a turbulent and over-buſy man; that the project being agreed they had dogg'd</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey <hi>ſeveral times; that at laſt about nine a Clock at night, the Conſpirators having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> Godfrey <hi>returning from St.</hi> Clements, Lawrence Hill <hi>went to the Gate toward the street, and meeting Sir</hi> Edmund, <hi>intreated him to come and part two men who were a fighting by the Water-ſide; that</hi> Godfrey <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving follow'd</hi> Hill, <hi>when they had him at the end of the Pales,</hi> Hill <hi>flung a cord about his neck and ſtrangled him; that</hi> Green <hi>finding he was not quite dead, wrung his neck about; that having kept the Corps ſome days, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it from place to place, at last they laid it a croſs a Horſe-back, carried it into the fields, and threw it into a Ditch, having firſt run his Sword through his body. Robert Jenniſon</hi> another Witneſs in <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s Tryal depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he had heard <hi>Ireland</hi> one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators ſay, <hi>that the</hi> Roman Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>was to be ſhortly ſet up in</hi> England; <hi>that there was but one perſon could hinder it, and that they could eaſily poiſon the King; that the ſame</hi> Ireland <hi>being told by the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that the King went a Hunting and a Fiſhing with a very thin Guard, ſaid he ſhould
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:97134:128"/>be very glad they were rid of the King:</hi> In <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Tryal, the ſame <hi>Jenniſon</hi> depoſes, that in the Meetings of the Prieſts and Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its he had been at, he heard them ſay, <hi>It was neceſſary for the Good of the</hi> Catholick Religion, <hi>to alter the Government, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it after the model of</hi> France; <hi>that</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>a Prieſt had ſolicited him to come along with him to help him to diſpatch the King; that the ſame Priest had ask'd him, if he knew any brave and reſolute</hi> Iriſh-men <hi>fit to give that great blow.</hi> That being in <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Chamber with many other Jeſuits, he had heard them ſay, that <hi>if</hi> C. R. <hi>would not be</hi> R. C. <hi>he ſhould not be long</hi> C. R. the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof was, that <hi>if</hi> Charles Rex <hi>would not be a</hi> Roman Catholick, <hi>he ſhould not long be</hi> Charles Rex; <hi>that they made him take the Sacrament and an Oath of Secrecy, and than diſcovered to him the whole Plot.</hi> In the ſame Tryal <hi>Smith</hi> declares, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been born a Proteſtant, Abbot <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutague</hi> and Father <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> had labour'd at <hi>Paris</hi> to make him a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that <hi>in a ſhort time the</hi> Catholick Religion <hi>ſhould be the praedominant Religion in</hi> England; that having deſign'd to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and paſſing through <hi>Provence</hi> in his way to <hi>Italy,</hi> they had oblig'd him to many Conferences with Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> who
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97134:129"/>at laſt perſwaded him to turn <hi>Catholick;</hi> and that he was made Prieſt: That Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi</hi> told him, <hi>he had Correſpondence with many great</hi> Engliſh <hi>Lords, that he was very well aſſur'd the</hi> Roman Catholick <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be prevalent in</hi> England; <hi>but that there was one man they muſt be rid of, and that was the King; that in truth he was a good Man, but however he must be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, becauſe he was an Obſtacle to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns:</hi> The ſame Witneſs ſays, that having left <hi>Provence,</hi> he went into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he continued long; and that he heard the Jeſuits ſay in their Sermons and ordinary diſcourſe, That <hi>the King of</hi> England <hi>was not truly King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was an Heretick, and that whoever kill'd him ſhould do a very meritorious act.</hi> And when he and five or ſix more were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to leave that houſe, the Fathers earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhorted them to maintain that Maxim, <hi>That People are not oblig'd to obey the King of</hi> England. And that they ſhould take care to inſtruct accordingly in Confeſſion, all thoſe they ſhould find capable to enter into this great deſign. There is another Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Dennis</hi> by name, a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and a <hi>Jacobine</hi> Monk; and ſuch at the time of his Depoſition, having neither quitted his Religion nor Order. This Monk depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97134:129"/>that being in <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in the Chamber of <hi>James Lenck</hi> an <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tuam;</hi> this Arch-Biſhop told him, That <hi>Dr.</hi> Oliver Plunket <hi>was to be imploy'd very ſpeedily to procure Succours from</hi> France, <hi>to be ſent into</hi> Ireland <hi>for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the</hi> Catholick Religion <hi>in</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>and that be the Arch-Biſhop would in a ſhort time go in perſon into that Countrey to advance ſo pious a work.</hi> The ſame Witneſs depoſes, that the Earl of <hi>Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> s Brother caus'd great Sums of Money to be levy'd in the Covents; and that they ſaid openly, <hi>this money was deſign'd for the bringing over an Army into</hi> Ireland, <hi>when time ſhould ſerve. Edward Turbervil,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witneſs, ſwears expreſly, <hi>That</hi> Stafford <hi>being lodg'd at</hi> Paris <hi>at the corner of</hi> Beaufort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, <hi>the Deponent came to him, and stay'd with him ſeveral days: That</hi> Stafford <hi>having taken an Oath of Secrecy from him not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what he ſhould truſt him with, he told him at last, they were in ſearch of one to kill the King of</hi> England, <hi>who was an Heretick, and conſequently no King, but rather a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against Almighty God, and that he ſolicited him to undertake this great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>

                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:97134:130"/>
                  <p>Here Sir, are a great many Witneſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow,</hi> who ſwear as home as they: Can any reaſonable man imagine, there can be found ſo many Infernal Spirits (as here are Witneſſes) capable to invent ſo horrible a Calumny to deſtroy a Religion and all that profeſs it? And if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſuborn one Witneſs or two, have you ever ſeen a preſident of ſuch a Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that hath gain'd ſo great a number of Witneſſes? Beſides, what is there improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this Hiſtory of the Plot? Is it not the Spirit and Cuſtom of your Bigots and blind Zealots to uſe ſuch means as theſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Religion? Read the Life of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and you will find ſhe was no ſooner delivered from one Conſpiracy, but another was fram'd againſt her. The words of <hi>Stafford</hi> who paſſes for a Martyr among you, are remarkable.</p>
                  <p>In his Speech to the <hi>Lord High-Steward,</hi>

                        <hi>Stafford</hi>'s <hi>Tryal,</hi> pag. 200.</note> and the Peers, his Judges, he declares, <hi>That he did believe, thoſe of the Roman Religion had (ſince the Reformation of the Church of</hi> England) <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into ſeveral most wicked and most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſpiracies; particularly the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of</hi> Babington, <hi>and that of the Earl of</hi> Weſtmorland, <hi>or the</hi> Northern <hi>Rebellion raiſed by the</hi> Papiſts <hi>in</hi> Queen Elizabeth<hi>'s
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:97134:130"/>time.</hi> He declares further, <hi>That he believ'd, there was a wicked Conſpiracy in the Reign of King</hi> James, <hi>wherein ſome of the Conſpirators were</hi> Roman-Catholicks, <hi>and ſome</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. <hi>And that after this followed that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable Plot, called</hi> The Gunpowder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And when Sir, could they have made choice of a more favourable time wherein to revive and reduce into practiſe thoſe bloudy Maxims, than a time when they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd themſelves, and were fully perſwaded, they ſhould find a King of their Religion in the Perſon of his Royal Highneſs? 'Tis true the King of <hi>England</hi> hath been favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to them in tolerating them; but they were notſatisfy'd with this, and having loſt all hopes of prevailing with him to turn <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick,</hi> they look'd upon his Life as a great Obſtacle to their Deſigns, for it made them loſe time, and they had reaſon to fear the <hi>Protestants</hi> in the interim might diſcover the deſign; ſo that it was their intereſt ſpeedily to make away a King, who poſſeſs'd the place of him from whom they promis'd themſelves a full re-eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> Recollect the Evidence, add to it the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Memoirs that were ſeiz'd, and the Murder of <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and I will juſtify it, a man muſt have the Forehead of a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:97134:131"/>Jeſuit to deny there was a Plot. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs and Letters are very numerous, you may read them in the printed Tryals; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly you will find a great Collection of them printed with <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Tryal. But, pray Sir, remember <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letter, I ſpoke to you of laſt year; that alone is enough to ſtop the mouths of thoſe who dare ſay this Plot is an invention of the <hi>Protestants.</hi> To which Calumny we will conſtantly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as an impenetrable Buckler, the words of that Letter, acknowledg'd by <hi>Coleman</hi> to be his. <hi>We have here a mighty work upon our hands, no leſs than the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and by that perhaps the utter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of a Pestilent Hereſy which has domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer'd over great part of this Northern World a long time:</hi> Coleman<hi>'s Tryal,</hi> pag. 69. I ſaid not a word t' you of another Letter as plain as this, which you may ſee in <hi>Ireland</hi>'s and <hi>Grove</hi>'s Tryals, where you will find words to this effect. <hi>Every one had notice not to make too much haſt to</hi> London, <hi>nor to be there long before the day appointed, nor to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear much in the Town, before the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ended, for fear of giving cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Deſign.</hi> This Letter doth not tell us what was the deſign of this famous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, but it lets us ſee, they had ſome great deſign in hand, and the Plot being
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:97134:131"/>diſcover'd at the ſame time, 'tis not hard to gueſs what it was: It hath been prov'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe of Commons, that upon the firſt diſcovery of the Plot, one of the Lords accus'd to have had a hand in it, writ to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the ſame Lords then in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> that their deſigns were diſcover'd, and that he ſhould uſe his beſt endeavours to conceal all ſuch their <hi>Catholick</hi> Friends as were concern'd in that affair. This Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was found by a Juſtice of the Peace in the houſe of that Lord to whom it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, upon the ſearch made for Arms in <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> houſes, and was produc'd to the Commons in Parliament with all the Witneſſes, to whom it was ſhew'd the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was found.</p>

                  <p>You have reaſon to wiſh, Gentlemen, that my Friend here had not been any better inſtructed than formerly in theſe matters, but had ſtill continued under his miſtake; that <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi> had not chang'd their Religion, but remain'd <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks</hi> after the Plot diſcover'd; for the pains he hath taken to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, have made him acquainted with many particulars which cannot pleaſe you, ſince they make it clearly appear there was a Plot.</p>

                  <p>We might have eaſily known all this already, being taken all out of thoſe Tryals printed in ſeveral Languages; but ſince you make uſe of them, you will allow me to do ſo; and give me leave to ask you whether the clearing of <hi>Wakeman,</hi> the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Phyſitian, be not an evident proof that all your Witneſſes are falſe Witneſſes? For they are in effect no other. <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi> charg'd <hi>Wakeman</hi> to have treated for fifteen thouſand pounds, for poyſoning the King: Here are two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, enough to Condemn a Man. Here is in queſtion one of the principal Crimes laid to the charge of the pretended Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, their deſign to make away the King, yet this man is acquitted by his Judges. It neceſſarily follows, your two famous Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were taken for falſe Witneſſes; and if they were not to be credited againſt <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> why ſhould they be credited againſt the reſt?</p>

                  <p>Do not ſay, Sir, that the clearing of Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> is a proof of his innocence, or of the falſhood of the Evidence; ſay rather, that the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice who ſate at that Tryal, hath been ſince impeach'd before the Peers of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament; and had the Parliament continued ſitting, perhaps that Judge had
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97134:132"/>ſmarted for it: The King was not very well ſatisfy'd of <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s innocence after his Acquittal: For that <hi>Poyſon Merchant</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the confidence to appear at Court after his enlargement, the King caus'd him to be turn'd out with ſhame.</p>

                  <p>There is one thing ſticks ſtill very hard with me as to this Plot; that of twelve or fifteen Perſons who have been executed for the pretended Conſpiracy, not one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf guilty in the leaſt. When Men are ready to appear before God, the Mask falls off it ſelf; the fear of Hell ſoftens the hardneſs of their hearts: You ſhall not ſee a Malefactor but diſcharges his Conſcience at his death; if ſome of them were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned enough to deny to the death, yet ſure one or other of them would have confeſs'd ſomething; but there hath not been one of them who did not proteſt to the laſt he was innocent.

                  <p>It ſurprizes me, Sir, to hear you make their obſtinate Silence an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their innocence; every day we ſee Criminals, who to ſave their Credit, and have the pleaſure of ſaying they dye inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, reſiſt the moſt violent Tortures:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97134:133"/>Yet you cannot comprehend, how Men who have long fortify'd their Courage, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for an Enterprize, the moſt dangerous that may be, have the power to keep till death, a Secret, on which depends not only their Honour, but the preſervation of all the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> Had they confeſs'd themſelves Guilty, they muſt have named their Complices; and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they would have deſtroy'd an infinite number of People, and render'd their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion abominable in the World, by making it appear, it inſpires into its Votaries ſuch horrible Sentiments, and gives Birth to ſuch furious deſigns: Theſe Conſiderations are of weight and ſtrength ſufficient to keep the weakeſt of Men from revealing a Secret of this importance. When the <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> was diſcover'd in 1605. not one of the Conſpirators confeſt; and nothing had ever been prov'd upon them out of their own mouths, had not the Judges had the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity to cauſe <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Hall</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd in two Dungeons, where they could ſpeak to one another; and in the Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Dungeons, there was a place they plac'd two Witneſſes in, who heard all the Priſoners ſaid, and gave ſo exact an Account of their Diſcourſe, that they confeſt all: But would you know the cauſe they keep
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:97134:133"/>their Secrets ſo well? 'Tis the horrible Oath they impoſe on all thoſe who enter into ſuch Conſpiracies: Read <hi>Mezeray,</hi> where I have left him open. <hi>The last of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, <hi>eight of the principal Conſpirators were executed at</hi> London <hi>for High-Treaſon; not one of them accus'd the Priests or the Monks, for they were oblig'd to Secrecy by terrible Oaths.</hi> To ſatisfy you fully in this particular, I will let you ſee the form of the Oath adminiſtred to all thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into this laſt Plot. There is a Copy of it.</p>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:97134:134"/>binding and looſeing given to his Holineſs by our</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he hath power to Depoſe all Heretick Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to put them out of their Office, or kill them.

                  <p>Well Sir, and what ſay you of this? This comes from good hands; from a great houſe allyed to that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> But had it fallen from the Clouds, we might have known it by the Character; had it been a forg'd piece, it muſt needs have been made by a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and one deeply vers'd in the Cabal of theſe blind Zealots; for there is not a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and but few <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who underſtand
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97134:135"/>the ſtyle and conduct of this Cabal with ſo much perfection, as he muſt have done, who ſhould invent this form of an Oath. And now, Sir, you may, if you can, draw from the ſilence of the Conſpirators an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the truth of the Plot.</p>

May not he who would have ſuborn'd Witneſſes againſt the Queen and firſt Prince of the Bloud, be rationally preſum'd to have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born'd Witneſſes againſt five or ſix pitiful Prieſts?</p>

                  <p>We hope, Sir, the innocence of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> will ſave him. Perhaps it will be objected, he may be more for a <hi>Republican</hi> Government, than may befit the Subject of a Monarchy; but we cannot believe him capable of the baſe actions he is charg'd with. If he miſcarry, he will not be the firſt innocent perſon hath periſh'd by the malice of falſe Witneſſes: Can any thing be clearer, than that this Charge againſt him is a Counter-battery rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97134:135"/>by your <hi>Catholicks?</hi> Nothing can be more proper to make men ſuſpect, that all hath been ſaid of the Plot, is meerly fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than to produce men to teſtify, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been us'd to ſuborn them: For if Endeavours have been us'd to ſuborn them, why not to ſuborn others? I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only this act of the Tragedy began ſo late: 'Tis true, we may ſee ſomething of it in <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s Tryal and in <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions: For this Witneſs tells us, he had ſeen a Letter ſent from <hi>Paris</hi> to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> from St. <hi>Omers</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Tixal,</hi> wherein it was advis'd, <hi>That the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>ſhould be accus'd of a Deſign against the King's Life, which would oblige thoſe of the Church of</hi> England <hi>to joyn with the</hi> Catholicks <hi>to destroy the</hi> Presbyterians. Obſerve now the Event of this Counſel: The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> is look'd upon as the head of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are the great Enemies of the Conſpirators, and labour with moſt Zeal the Diſcovery of the Plot. We muſt deſtroy their Credit, ſay you, and charge them with the blackeſt of Crimes; and who are the Witneſſes made uſe of againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury?</hi> They are all <hi>Roman Catholicks:</hi> Can you think it a hard matter in a buſineſs where the ſafety of a whole Party and of the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97134:136"/>
                     <hi>Roman</hi> Religion is at ſtake, to find five or ſix perſons who will Sacrifice themſelves to ſave the honour of their Religion, and the Life of their Patriarchs? And how do they Sacrifice themſelves? Their Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſwade them, that to bear falſe Witneſs againſt <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> the great Enemy of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is ſo far from being an offence to God, that they do him very conſiderable Service in it. So that inſtead of one or two, I believe they may find a hundred falſe Witneſſes in this affair; and this is the cauſe honeſt men are ſo much in fear for the Life of that Lord. But let us ſuppoſe things to be as you would have them; let us put the Caſe that <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> is the moſt wicked of men; doth it follow, that becauſe out of hatred to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and for Excluding the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from the Succeſſion, he would have ſuborn'd ſome Witneſſes againſt the Queen and the Duke; he muſt therefore have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and invented this long train of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and that multitude of particular matters of Fact, Letters, Meetings, and Conſultations, that appear in the Hiſtory of the Plot? Doth it follow, that becauſe he would have ſuborn'd Witneſſes, he muſt therefore ſucceed in it? Or if he hath had the fortune to find one Wretch or two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97134:136"/>to be Suborn'd, is it probable he could have found out ſo great a number? Hath he ſearch'd <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> all over, to ſcum out for his purpoſe all the Raſcals ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to give and maintain a falſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? How many Witneſſes have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd about the Plot in <hi>Ireland?</hi> Hath the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> Suborn'd them too? Is this probable, Sir, or will any man believe it?</p>

                     <hi>The King of</hi> England <hi>had promis'd us at his Marriage, that the</hi> Catholick Religion <hi>ſhould be re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in</hi> England, <hi>and becauſe he put it off from time to time, we often call'd upon him to perform his promiſe;</hi> we were ſo plain, as to tell him, That <hi>if he did it not we ſhould be forc'd to make uſe of means to deſtroy him: We gave him fair warning, and becauſe he would not follow our advice, nor keep his

The Author who produces this Proof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces alſo a Letter from a Secretary of State, who was actually in the Service of the Crown, when the Accuſation was brought againſt the Jeſuits about the Death of the King; this Secretary, whoſe name was <hi>Morrice,</hi> in anſwer to a Letter from the Author of the Accuſation, ſays to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>I am not allow'd, nor does it become me to make Conjectures, or draw Conſequences from the Orders his Majesty gave me concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you, beyond what he hath preciſely expreſt.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97134:138"/>of the <hi>Independants</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and that they would make work enough there. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady at <hi>Paris,</hi> being ſeduc'd by a Jeſuit, turn'd <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> ſoon after came the news of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Death: The Jeſuit viſiting the Lady, found her all in Tears for this lamentable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays the Jeſuit ſmiling, <hi>you have no reaſon to lament what hath happened, the</hi> Catholicks <hi>are delivered of the greateſt Enemy they had, and his Death will be much to the advantage of the</hi> Catholick Religion. The Lady angry at this diſcourſe, ſent the Jeſuit packing down Stairs, and conceiv'd ſuch horrour againſt the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> ſhe would never after endure to hear ſpeak of it.

The high State your Majeſty is in, deprives of courſe the greateſt part of your Subjects of the Liberty to preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; but the Sentiments endeavour'd to be inſpir'd into your Majeſty, to the diſadvantage of your Subjects of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> keep them at greater diſtance, and abſolutely take from them the advantage of appearing before you, to preſent to your view the true pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of their Miſeries; to prevent being dazl'd with the Luſtre of your Throne, they have put a vail between themſelves and Your Majeſty, and have drawn a Curtain, behind which they may make their Complaints, by a voice out of the Ground. If this voice have the good
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97134:139"/>fortune to reach Your Majeſties Ear, be Graciouſly pleas'd to give it Audience, and to look upon this private unknown Perſon as a poor Wretch, who in the name of Millions of other Wretches is come to Expoſe to Your Majeſties view their common Calamities, and to have an end put to their Miſeries by Your Majeſties Juſtice and Mercy: Their Miſeries are extream, had they been but ordinary, we ſhould have ſubmitted with ſilence; It will not be believ'd, that under the Reign of the greateſt of our Kings, of him who was born for the Glory and Happineſs of <hi>France,</hi> there is ſo great a number of miſerable Perſons within an inch of Deſpair; but 'tis Your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sir, is the cauſe of our Calamities, by giving way to the malice of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by permitting it ſelf to be ſurpriz'd by the Counſels of our Perſecutors.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:97134:140"/>of terrour and fear, by ſhewing them Your Majeſties Arm always lifted up for their ruine: Thus they endeavour to make us hate him as a Tyrant, whom by duty and inclination we love as the beſt of our Kings. We know very well, Sir, that to ſurprize Your Majeſty they make uſe of an apparent Piety, and mind you of the Name, Your Majeſty bears, of <hi>Most Chriſtian,</hi> to inſpire into Your Majeſty thoſe Sentiments ſo diſaſtrous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to us; but in the Name of God we Conjure Your Majeſty to conſider, that thoſe Councels of breach of promiſe and of violence, are abſolutely contrary to the Spirit of true Religion.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97134:141"/>they force to turn by Baſtonade, fear of Poverty, and other Violences exercis'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, cannot but become Hypocrites and profane, deteſting in their hearts thoſe ſacred things they are forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in appearance. Your Majeſty is told, the Parents are ill Chriſtians, but their Children will be good <hi>Catholicks;</hi> but we conjure Your Majeſty to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the falſe zeal of our Perſecutors makes as many <hi>Criminals,</hi> as it pretends to make <hi>Catholicks;</hi> and that by the Law of God, Children are puniſhable for the Crimes of their Parents; the unhappy Parents look upon them as Tyrants, who fetter their Conſciences; they are Rebels in their hearts, and will never let ſlip any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be reveng'd for the Oppreſſion they are under; how can it be hop'd, God will bleſs the poſterity of thoſe baſe Wretches, who for fear of ſome Temporal Puniſhment, or hope of ſome inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage, Renounce a Religion they believe to be true, and harbour in their hearts Rebellion againſt their Soveraigns? Theſe Sentiments will be tranſmitted to their poſterity; for it is natural for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to inſpire their thoughts into their Children. Thus Your Majeſty ſhall ſee
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:97134:142"/>continued in Your Kingdom a Generation of Male-Contents, of Diſſmblers, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, Rebellious, and ill Chriſtians; ſuch will be the good <hi>Catholicks</hi> begot of thoſe Parents, who are at this day forc'd to change their Religion. Among this wretched Multitude there will doubtleſs be ſome, who totally forgetting their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will take deſperate Reſolutions, and chooſe rather to die in a violent manner, than to live reduc'd to a condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they betray their Conſcience and ſuffer a thouſand Calamities; and it cannot but infinitely grieve Your Majeſties good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Clemency, to ſee your ſelf forc'd to revive the Age of Maſſacres: Our zeal for Your Majeſties Service holds out hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto againſt the ſence of our preſent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and the fear of future ills; Your Majeſty hath not in Your Armies by Sea or Land, an <hi>Hugonot</hi> Officer who is not ready to ſacrifice his Life in Your Service: There is not Your Kingdom a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> who doth not venerate, (I may ſay adore) Your Majeſty, as the brighteſt Image God hath given of himſelf to the World; we hope, they will always look upon the Thunderbolts that come from your hand, with that reſpect and fear they regard
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:97134:142"/>thoſe that fall from Heaven; but we hope alſo, Your Majeſty in imitation of that Divinity, whoſe Image you are, will pity ſo many miſerable Perſons who groan under their Sufferings, without murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the hand that cauſes them. Eſpecially, when you conſider theſe Wretches have all <hi>Europe</hi> to witneſs their faithfulneſs to Your Service; and the World ſees them free from the leaſt ſtain of Rebellion: Your Majeſty will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to be perſecuted any longer for no other reaſon, but becauſe, as 'tis ſuppos'd, we are not illuminated. Alas, Sir, 'tis a Grace that depends not upon our ſelves, 'tis not a thing within the power of Man, nor is it an effect of fear, puniſhments and tortures. We doubt not, but if Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would take the pains to caſt Your Eye, upon the Arreſts and Orders exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Your Majeſty againſt us, and the Conſequences of them, they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear dreadful and horrible; Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſhould ſee Trade interrupted and ſpoil'd, Your Towns deſolate by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the Inhabitants, and a great breach in Your State by the loſs of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable Members of it ready to fly out of it; you ſhould ſee your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:97134:143"/>enrich'd and fortify'd by the ſpoils of Your Kingdom, <hi>France</hi> in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, become a vaſt Deſart, and a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of unhappy Conſciences, groaning under a cruel Servitude they are reduc'd to; You ſhould ſee a People in deſpair, capable of the moſt violent Reſolutions againſt themſelves. We hope, Sir, that God the Protector of <hi>Afflicted Innocents,</hi> will lay open all theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to Your Majeſties Eyes, that you may act as the common Father of Your Subjects: We remember, Sir, that kind and excellent Expreſſion of Your Majeſty, not long ſince; <hi>That You conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd us all as Your Children, and would have given Your Right Hand for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion:</hi> Here we ſee Your Majeſty in Your Natural ſtate, and admire the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine goodneſs of Your temper, and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded 'tis not without violence you are obliged to arm Your ſelf againſt us, as if we were Your Enemies. When Children have attain'd the age of diſcretion, their Parents uſe only the ways of perſwaſion to reduce them to Duty; becauſe the heart is not won but by fair and gentle means, and our Spirits naturally abhor and reſiſt force. We hope therefore, Your
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:97134:143"/>Majeſty will again awaken Your Paternal Compaſſions towards thoſe Children whom you look upon as gone aſtray; and that you will leave it to Heaven and it's Grace, to reduce them into the right way, if out of it, and that You will not permit our Conſciences to be dragg'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paths which we are not perſwaded are right: 'Tis this hope alone, Sir, keeps us from falling into deſpair, this only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports us; this will ever make us moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Petitioners to Heaven, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Your Royal Perſon, for Your Glory, and the good Succeſs of all Your Deſigns.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu deſire I would inform you, what you are to believe of the Reports ſpread in the Province you are in, of the great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigations lately happen'd (as 'tis ſaid) in the Affairs of our Religion. A Man cannot write with much certainty of theſe matters, yet I will venture to comply with your deſires; never were Reports more groundleſs than thoſe, for matters are ſo far from being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, they begin to be worſe than ever: The buſineſs between the Bayliff of <hi>Charanton</hi> and the Gentlemen of the Conſistory, is reviv'd. You know, without doubt, that the King upon the Petition they preſented him, had order'd the Bayliff not to proceed any further, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:97134:145"/>gave them leave in the mean time to apply themſelves if they ſaw cauſe, to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Remedy; but within theſe five or ſix days the Chancellor ſaid to the Deputy-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it was much wondred the Conſistory had not ſued forth an Appeal from the Sentence of the Bayliff, that they must look to it; for if they would not appeal, the King would take off the Prohibition, and give the Bayliff leave to proceed: What is the meaning of this, but to let us ſee they intend to Extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate us? for questionleſs you remember, one Article of that Sentence was, that we ſhould pay the Sacrament ſuch reſpect as is due to it. Whether what was ſaid to Monſieur <hi>Ruvigny</hi> will take effect, I know not; but you know well enough, that in what concerns us, they do not their buſineſs by half, but go through with their work. The Provinces of <hi>Poitou</hi> and <hi>Aunix</hi> are in a condition that deſerves all manner of Compaſſion, all acts of the moſt Barbarous Cruelty are exercis'd in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; the Relations we have thence would break your heart: 'Tis true, the Troops are drawn out, which is the only ground I know for the reports of mitigation; but the Forces were drawn out of <hi>Poitou,</hi> for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe there was buſineſs to imploy them elſewhere, or to lay the noiſe the violence of their proceedings rais'd in thoſe parts: In
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:97134:145"/>all other points, the Perſecution in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces is not at all abated; from <hi>Poitiers</hi> to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> there is not a Minister to be ſeen; and in all that Province, formerly full of places for Religious Worſhip, there are not ſix places but the Churches are ſhut up, or the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſilenced; all thoſe Churches which were appendants of Mannors, the tenure whereof gave Right to the Lords to have Religious Worſhip perform'd there, were all ſhut up on the ſudden: The Ministers of other Churches yet standing, are ſome confin'd, others ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, others ſilenc'd, and most impriſon'd, Monſieur <hi>Boſſatran</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Niort,</hi> and ſeven of his Elders, are Priſoners at <hi>Rochelle;</hi> The Sieurs <hi>Paumier, D'Iſle, Champion, Le Pain, Du Son, Loquet,</hi> Ministers of St. <hi>Maixaut, de la Motte, de Mougon, de Fontenay, de Marennes,</hi> and many others, have had Sentence pronounc'd againſt them, that their Goods ſhall be ſold, or are impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, or fled, or baniſh'd; one is confin'd to <hi>Vezelay,</hi> another to <hi>Bezomſon,</hi> others to other places, ſo that in all theſe Provinces you can hardly find one officiating Minister; this new kind of Perſecution is exercis'd upon pretence, that the Miniſters gave Certificates to thoſe who are gone out of the Kingdom; they Proſecute with that Cruely thoſe who give relief to theſe miſerable Fugitives, that Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:97134:146"/>of <hi>Rochell</hi> have been impriſon'd and fined for giving them a glaſs of water. The Marqueſs of <hi>Dompierre,</hi> a Gentleman of Note, hath been a long time Priſoner for harbouring forty or fifty poor men, who were in ſearch of means to ſet themſelves at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the tyranny exercis'd upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. 'Tis true, the Intendant <hi>Marillac</hi> hath not any Soldiers left; but he ſtirs not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without his Deputies and his Guards, who act the ſame Out-rages the Soldiers did: He ſends before him his Harbingers into the Villages to frighten them; when arriv'd, he calls before him the Inhabitants of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Profeſſion,</hi> exhorts them to obey the King's Orders and embrace his Religion; thoſe who carry his Orders about, obſerve no Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Menaces, Promiſes, Troubles newly rais'd or reviv'd, Diſcharges, Officers pay, eaſing thoſe who have been over-rated in Aſſeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and money distributed, have made an infinite number of Revolters: The Shepherds are ſmitten that the flocks maybe ſcatter'd. The Miniſters of all Churches held by right of Tenure, are tax'd in aſſeſſments to the King, that they may be forc'd to deſert: The violence is ſo terrible and exceſſive, by the Taxes they aſſeſs for payment of Offices (as they call them) that the Country is not eas'd in the leaſt by the Soldiers being drawn out; thoſe who the laſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:97134:146"/>year were tax'd but at thirty Livers, have this year been tax'd by the Intendant at five or ſix hundred. Thus all are obliged to deſert, and if any one leave his houſe he is carried to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, under pretence he was going out of the Kingdom. 'Tis certain that nothing but an inability of getting out, hath retain'd in the Provinces any Perſon of the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> and you may be aſſur'd, that the next Spring Millions will follow you into strange Countries; they who cannot go out at the Door will leap out at the Window, and truſt the mercy of the Waves to convey them to ſome Veſſel at Sea: God grant the poor Wretches may in forreign parts meet with tender Hearts and Compaſſionate Souls; theſe reports of mitigation are rais'd by our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, on deſign to cool the fervor of that Charity, thoſe <hi>Proteſtant Countries</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Peace God hath taken from us, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd toward our fugitive Brethren; and thoſe Enemies are in the midſt of us as well as among our Adverſaries. We have among us ſome wretched Traytors who ſpread a Report, that we ſhall ſhortly ſee a great change of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; that there ſhall be a Reformation in <hi>France,</hi> not of us, but a Reformation of far greater value and importance, and therefore we are not to think of leaving the Kingdom. Theſe Men catch new hold, when others let
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97134:147"/>go theirs, and fancy grounds of freſh hopes, where others ſee nothing but cauſe of Deſpair: You underſtand well enough what ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons think, and what is to be expected from them. This, Sir, you are to believe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigations you have heard of: What I have now told you is truth, of which I have been an Ocular Witneſs, being lately return'd out of the places where the Facts have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; you ſee there is cauſe to wiſh your Gazet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers had better Information or better Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and would not Stuff their Gazettes with News grounded on intelligence altogether falſe: We have had a flying Report that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac</hi> will be recall'd, but 'tis as true as the reſt. Expect not he ſhall be Revok'd till he hath compleated our ruine in the Province of <hi>Poitou;</hi> the deſign of this Letter was only to inform you of the particulars you deſir'd to know; I will not make it longer, but Conclude with aſſuring, you I am,</p>
